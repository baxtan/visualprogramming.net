now we got something here this time... 

besides a couple of fixes as you can see in the changelog we'd like to particularly point your interest to the fine (and massive) drop of arduino/firmata girlpowers by {{< user "jens.a.e" >}} to whom we're also of course still greatful for the arduino/firmata nodes that come with this very same pack already since quite a while now. those are finally the demos he promised from his node13 workshop + some more as it seems. find them under:
 \addonpack\girlpower\Arduino

gut patch!
