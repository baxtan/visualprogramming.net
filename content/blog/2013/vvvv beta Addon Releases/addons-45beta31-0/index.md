If i am not mistaken there are only minor changes this time:

With all kinect nodes FOV is now given in cylces (was a mix of radians or degrees). Also the rotations for ms-kinect face are now cycles.

The Gui2d modules work again, but have a bug in multitouch mode.

Everything else just as good as before.
