I think everything will change after Vvvvux11 release.

When I saw a vvvv render for the first time I said:

WOW

that is a superformula !!

It was something cool to see, hypnotic ... really much better than processing. I passed whole nights patching, arriving at 11:40 AM at my job place.

Now, I'm sure that I will feel again that trippy sensation with the incoming Render (Vvvvux11).
