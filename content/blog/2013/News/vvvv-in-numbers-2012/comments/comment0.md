Thanks for this joreg , very interesting information which gives a good perspective on vvvv's progress and lifeline. I highly agree that when users begin to make some sort of profits from vvvv they should buy it, even if it is using it for paid teaching. I've been enjoying vvvv since 2007, I'm planning to use it in a few years when I'll be an academic in a university teaching architectural design + theory, and I will gladly purchase the license. The high-times for vvvv is inevitable...
