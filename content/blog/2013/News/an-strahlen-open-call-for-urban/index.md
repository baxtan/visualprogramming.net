Hey all,
we´re planning a little event/happening/workshop during NODE 2013:

{{< box >}}
Bring your laptop/patches/movie file on USB stick for a 5-minute screening in front of the Frankfurter Kunstverein. There is a beamer and audience, but no screen – you can select from available fabrics, cloth, paper etc. and create the screen you like – either build it in advance or create one on site. Moving, collapsing, static. Or gather a group of people and let them be your screen.

It’s not about precision, it’s about improvisation and having fun.
