as we've been kindly informed by {{< user "vux" >}} our protection mechanism has a flaw that lets someone with access to the dongle (for a specific project) and knowledge of the vvvv-api dump out un-encrypted patches since the api simply has functionality for this (which e.g. is used by vvvv's ctrl+g node-grouping feature). 

note that this does not compromise the encryption itself. so without access to a dongle this would not be possible and also if you have a dongle you'd only be able to access exactly the project that dongle was for. 

vux sent us a couple of suggestions to improve on this and we'll be updating you with our progress on this.
