Strukt Design Studio, based in Vienna, Austria, is looking for an interns. We create interactive media installations and design concepts for corporate and cultural events.

As an intern you will work on projects as supporting staff member. You will never have to fix us coffee or pick up our food, no worries. We want you to be an essential part of the production. We will most likely challange you, but in return we will award you with more and more responsibility during jobs.
<!--break-->
Our interactive media installation department works with VVVV but we also welcome students knowing processing, Actionscript 3 or C++. But what's most important to us is that your programming skills are completed by a strong sense for design and esthetics, since we are not only a studio for technical solutions but mainly providers for creative content running on our technical installations.

If you think you have something to add to our team, don't hesitate to contact us. We would prefer to meet you in person aswell, but if you are located too far away we are happy to have skype- or ichat-conferences as well.

We have no more open positions for interns in the summer but if you could start in September or later please send you application to jobs{}strukt.com as a PDF or weblink. Please don't send anything in the mail.
