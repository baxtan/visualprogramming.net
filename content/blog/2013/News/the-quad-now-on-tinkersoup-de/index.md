It is with great pleasure that today after a year of tough negotiations we can finally announce a winner in the bidding for a license to monetize the Quad. We congratulate the [TinkerSoup - Berlin Based Electronic Kitchen](http://tinkersoup.de) online store who beat competitors like the itunes-store, google-play and the amazon-marketplace for reasons undisclosed.

So just-in-time for this consumerist time of the year we announce the immediate availabilty of all the Quads in the series. The quads offer an ultimate universal unibody user experience. They are massively multitouch and only your imagination is the limit of their applications. Manufactured from pure concrete with a grain size of 1mm max and doubly reinforced for extra strengh they are also totally vegan. The Quad comes in four flavours NANO, MINI, CLASSIC and MEGA.

Also incidentally this announcement comes not randomly but exactly one year after the Quads initial materialization that was 10 days before the 10th anniversary of vvvv which was celebrated with a befitting festivity at the [Letters Are My Friends - Typographic Concept Store](http://lettersaremyfriends.com/) which by [the press](http://createdigitalmotion.com/2012/12/with-pop-up-store-party-and-rectangles-vvvv-celebrates-10-years-of-visual-power-gallery/) was dubbed "no ordinary party". Well,... it brought together all the international vvvv jetset, they served alcohol and look, they even sent a tv-crew:
