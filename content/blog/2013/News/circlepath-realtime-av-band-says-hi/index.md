![circlepath realtime AV](rp_cp.jpg) 

hi vvvv crew and doom-AV fans,

we are a realtime AV band from sunny sydney, australia.

we make songs about supernovas, the universe ending, the emptiness of space.

here are some of our recordings from last year, some live and some made in the studio - we hope you like them!

they are 100% vvvv

stay tuned for more in 2013
