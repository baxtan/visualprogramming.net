mmm, houston, we have a problem :)
i've downloaded, but FileTexture (DX11 2d.Pooled)dosen't exist.
tried all things to avoid my fault (downloaded twice, deleted the old, started vvvv without dx11 and then copied things in packs)but nothing to do. nothing pooled around here :D

can someone confirm or disconfirm?
