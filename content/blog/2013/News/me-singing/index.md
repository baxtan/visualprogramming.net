Interactive video installation consisting of  49 synchronously playing  "Me singing Skyfall..."  youtube videos. Thanks to all the singers whose interpretations are used in this installation.

I tired to accomplish this in vvvv, but had problems with synchronous playback. Forty nine streams of uncompressed sound plus interactivity. Finally created in PureData
