Hey Hierro,

there are a lot of vvvv professionals in the LinkedIn group - most of whom will get an email with your request. As Fibo suggested it may attract more attention (if you haven't found a hungry devvvveloper yet).

Having said that I'm still not sure LinkedIn is the right place for advertising vvvv jobs. There are a lot of members here who do not have a LinkedIn account. It would be nice to have a forum section dedicated to projects that could be subscribed to by members to receive alerts, guess there is a reason this hasn't happened yet though?
