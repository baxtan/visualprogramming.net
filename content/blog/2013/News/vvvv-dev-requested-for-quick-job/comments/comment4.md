hi gaz, I created the linkedin group, because there is not job section in vvvv.org and Linkedin is the most used social network for that purpouse.

Also consider that many people that can hire vvvv developers have not a vvvv account, and probably they have already a Linkedin account.

Anyway, your feeling probably is very common, since there was only one job posting :)

By the way, I created the group thinking about giving the administrator rights to other people some day, maybe to a devvvv or Meso guy so it could become the job section for vvvv.
