![»Prototyping Interfaces« X-Mas Contest](Gewinnspiel_Items2-01.jpg) 

Just in time for the holiday season: The »Prototyping Interfaces« X-Mas Contest! We have two copies of the book to give away, so we challenge you to show us why you should get one of them. 

If you want to win, here is what you have to do: Comment on the contest post on facebook with a 1280x720 image/video that shows your typographic take on the title of our book »Prototyping Interfaces«. Everything goes - use whatever tool you want. Draw it, sketch it, code it, make a photo, do whatever you like and show us what your idea of prototyping looks like. 

The deadline for submissions is December 8th. The winners will be announced on December 15th.

Have fun and let us know if you have any questions.
