Uhyeah this project (the "Videochat" part) was fun. First time working with vvvv and I had {{< user "tonfilm" >}} as Zen Master!

Next week I'll get one of those 8-Screen-Walls installed in our office so I can learn/try/do some nice animations in vvvv on it... f#*& yeah!

btw. it was >500 Megabyte/s on our RAID not MegaPixel, 1067MB/s to be precise ;)
