Vision Nocturne presents Cubix, an interactive multitouch audiovisual installation, further developed during a two-week residency at iMAL.

Cubix consists in a cube of 27m3, shaped by a metalic structure and white translucide material. It generates abstract aesthetics from a simple cube, both sensorial and immersive. Cubix invites the public to enter the structure and discover its tactile, audio and visual dimension thanks to a multitouch table placed inside the cube and which allows visitors to make evolve projected animations on the cube.
