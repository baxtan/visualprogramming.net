I have also often thought of programming a solution for this problem, but I need one which also can determine the 3d geometry of the projection surface, works with front and rear projection and allows for a fast recalibration (of the screen off course because this changes by far more than the projectors). My setups are usually up to 8 projectors. At the moment I have written a little app in processing, which also needs computed 3d geometry and spits out warping data, but it is very slow and lacks of lens corrections. So manual adjustment is still needed but it reduces my setup times by ca. 40%.

Mrboni, Elliotwoods, I have a customer, who may be interested in such a system. How serious are you about it? I'd like to team up, even if it may end up as a shareware or whatsoever. Looks like a little winter project.
