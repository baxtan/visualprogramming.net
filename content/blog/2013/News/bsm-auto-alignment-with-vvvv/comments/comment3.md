@alec: we prepared modules that read the .txt and blend.bmp which you can use to apply the alignment to your vvvv renderers. an example patch isn't of much use without an actual setup and its calibration data. 
so all the vvvv user has to understand is that it is trivial to use the data computed by bsm autoalignment with vvvv.
