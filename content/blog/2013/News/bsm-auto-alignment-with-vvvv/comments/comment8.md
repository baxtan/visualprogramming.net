@elliot
for my email enquiry
Its pricey. *edit by request

So we get back to crowd funding again!
Set a price and we'll see who is up for chipping in!
Their price is ridiculous, its basically per project, and per projector, and while very useful, its something that wings has been doing for some years, and is also something that can be done manually for less in day rates than their solution!
