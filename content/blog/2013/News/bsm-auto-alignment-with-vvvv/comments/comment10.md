well, there seems to be a misinterpretation of the technology offered. this is not a wings competitor. while they can do the same thing that wings can do (for which scenarios i'm sure they'll charge much less) this system can align across multiple pcs/kameras and once installed recalibrates in a fraction of the time/cost someone could do that manually. 

think 10+ projections on curved surfaces (domes,..where projections overlap differently on all sides) and longterm installations. so while the price may seem ridiculous it is equally ridiculous to understand what you don't have to care about when just using it.
