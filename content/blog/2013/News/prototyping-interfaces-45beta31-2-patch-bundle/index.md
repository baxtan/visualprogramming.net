We got a present for your christmas holidays. We - the Prototyping Interfaces team, finally updated all our patches to get them up and running with the latest version of vvvv: 45beta31.2!

Get the bundle here: http://prototypinginterfaces.com/

As a reference you can still download the patch bundle for vvvv_45beta29.2, which is exactly the version we used while developing the book.

Merry X-Mas
