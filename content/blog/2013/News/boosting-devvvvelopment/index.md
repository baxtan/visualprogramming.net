Ciao all,

it's {{< user "fibo" >}} here.

I saw the creator of jQuery using Gittip for donations, and I thought it could be a good idea to create a vvvv group to make it easy donate a small amount to incentivate people that develops plugins, contributions and other vvvv stuff.

It really could boost vvvv contributions development. For example you could donate to vux for his huge work on DX11 implementation.

Check this out

https://www.gittip.com/for/vvvv/

At the time of this writing, we still need 53 members to unlock the community and start with donations. VVVV would be the 9th gittip community (see https://www.gittip.com/for/) so it would also helping spreading the vvvvord.

So join and tell everybody (grand mothers allowed :)

Ciaooooo
fibo
