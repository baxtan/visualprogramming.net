![](February-27th---Post-Node.jpg) 

If you made it to Node, come down for a drink and a natter. If you didn't, come down for a quick drink and a natter. If you have no idea what Node was and you're completely new to vvvv, come and have a drink and a natter. If you... just come join us next week, in a nice pub, where you can talk shop to your heart's content.

All the best,

Hayden

PS please note this is a pub, not Modern Jago, but its nearby.
