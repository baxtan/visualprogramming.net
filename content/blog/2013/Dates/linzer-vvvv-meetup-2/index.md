We go in the second round and as we have to stay on the move we also have a new Meet Up place that we contracted after todays Lock Picking Workshop:

/dev/lol Developer Lab of Linz
 <https://devlol.org/wiki/DevLoL/Location>

Topics:
- Moritz Haberkorn (morast / <morast.at)) and Gregor Woschitz (Grogi> will tell us something about past and ongoing projects and techniques. 

- Open Discussion about interesting / new things in the field.

- Correspondence to other User Groups and Meet Ups around the world.
