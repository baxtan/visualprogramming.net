Hi VVVV lovers !!, 

     If you are in Bilbao in November we can meet in BIME HACKDAY. 
We will talk about the new programming 
paradigm: Flow Based Programming.
 Students from Basque Country University are all using VVVV 
so we have here a
 very big community !!  
It is all about  connecting Music , artists and developers.
 Hope you can be there so we can  
hack all together!!
