In July and August the NODE+CODE meetup is a guest of the DAM gallery in Frankfurt. In this context we are putting more focus on the arts in relation to the digital.

On July 30th at 7 pm we start with two contributions from the complex of relations and questions on "art and systems".

Frankfurt based artists Amin Weber will present parts of his work on the Motion Bank dance research project for The Forsythe Company. Weber approached the complex choreographic system that the practice of american choreographer Deborah Hay can be understood as by adapting her solo dance piece "No Time To Fly" as 3D animation. He will report on the steps taken and how not using a human body affected his process. Further he can share what working in this was meant to him an Deborah Hay and how his adaptation fits into the research process itself.

In the second part of the evening Prof. Dr. phil. Dipl. theol. Gerd Döben-Henisch will introduce the "emerging mind project". As a research project in the field of artificial intelligence it is set up as a system to produce artists along the way. To do so environments are to be created that through tasks and interaction with the "external world" are to help minds emerge. Gerd Döben-Henisch will explain the plan on how to set up this system, the interfaces it will have and interaction it will allow. Trying to tackle two unsolved problems, namely creating an artificial mind and making computers create art, this raises quite a lot of questions that we are eager to discuss with you on Tuesday.
