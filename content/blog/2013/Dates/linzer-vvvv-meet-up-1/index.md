We are kindly inviting everybody interested in VVVV to our regular patcher meet up in Linz. Our plan is to meet every two weeks and discuss more or less advanced topics of VVVV. Most likely a little bit of beer will be involved, too.

At this first date we meet on tuesday, 29 of October, 7:30 pm at the entrance of Kunstuni in Kollegiumsgasse 2 to organize the following meet ups, plan some things and talk about what is bugging us the most at the moment.

Feel free to check by!
