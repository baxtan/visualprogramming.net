V4Wednesday introduces Retina of the Mindâ€™s Eye,  the name coming from the David Cronenburg's cult classic, Videodrome, a channel that permanently alters the viewer's perceptions.

Guest curated by CivicTV, this is an evening evening with the technologist and musician Bioni Samp, featuring a number of hacker/musicians performing audio visual pieces

We will be showcasing the work of 20 artists including four live performances from Bioni Samp, James B L Hollands, Letraruido & Tom Webster and Andrea Ruffino & Rebecca Salvadori. I might get in the mix too.
