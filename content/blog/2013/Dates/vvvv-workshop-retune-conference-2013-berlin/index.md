## ABOUT RETUNE
Around the world new technologies and new means of production and distribution enable unprecedented innovation and creative expression; while the sharing, forking and remixing of knowledge blend traditional fields in a way that informs and inspires new questions, theories and methods.

The retune.13 - creative technology conference is a gathering of artists, scientists, designers, hackers and entrepreneurs who are engaged in these developments, and looking to exchange their ideas and questions on new ways of working, thinking and expressing with technology.

retune.13 takes place from Sept 27 – 29 2013 in Berlin. It is a single-track conference of hand-picked workshops and talks, with limited participants, and generous time for discussing and connecting.

## VVVV - REAL WORLD COMPUTING
Computer science is a very young and evolving topic in human history. Textual programming as it's commonly used today emerged from early machine languages and is clearly not the end of the story. In this workshop you will learn what comfort, development speed and freedom you will gain from using the visual realtime programming environment vvvv.

After a little theory we will dig into examples which demonstrate some of vvvv's magic powers. The topics may include (in random order):
- visual programming
- setting up a vvvv project
- video input and analysis
- kinect, leap
- 3d scenes
- shaders
- textual programming in vvvv
- connecting hardware and sensors

The workshop is held by Tebjan Halm and joreg, who are both core developers of vvvv.

you need:
- laptop with decent graphics card and windows operating system
- vvvv (32-bit) with addonpack installed and working: vvvv.org
- 3-button mouse (or die!)
- if you like, some hardware you want to conenct to
fee: 15€, max. 20 participants
