Along a small marathon that will be held at the college, we'll run a workshop of video mapping with vvvv. 
It will introduce 2D mapping techniques by designing physical models or architectural structures and applying on it different methodes of mapping. We will create content on spot and manipulate it with kinect and standard cameras.
