You might wonder what happened with the visuals.

They will come soon! For now we wanted to release the audio first and give out music videos slowly over time.
We make an **Open Call** for visual productions to the release. just send a mail with the idea to davidgann@symbioticcube.com if you want to make a visual or music video to one of the tracks. We will screen the visuals at the release party and put them up on our fancy vvvvjs page which is coming soon. 
Also we are looking for new AV or Live-Performance artists to contribute to our future releases!
