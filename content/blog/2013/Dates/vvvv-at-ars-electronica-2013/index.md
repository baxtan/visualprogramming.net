According to wikipedia the [Ars Electronica Festival](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Electronica#Festival) is the "..the most important festival of digital art world wide." Unfortunately this quote is missing a citation, so who knows what it really is...

What it is for sure is a great opportunity to meet fellow v-heads and since the 4 day program is always quite confused with other stuff, here is a collection of vvvv stuff we arranged for you to concentrate on:

**Thursday**
In the afternoon i'll be talking "Completing Reality" on the [Expanded Animation](http://www.expandedanimation.com/?page_id=7) symposium doing some livvvve demos. See the link for details and speaker lineup.

**Friday**
In case you have a ticket for the [Ars Electronica Gala](http://www.aec.at/totalrecall/2013/07/29/ars-electronica-gala/) you'll not be able to avoid seeing what {{< user "robotanton" >}} is working on at the moment.

After the gala we march down to the harbour for some mojitos at time's up's bi-annual [tabula rasa](http://timesup.org/content/tabula-rasa).

**Saturday**
After Klangwolke we just cross the street and get wasted at the [symbioticcube-av-label-release-party](/blog/2013/symbioticcube-av-label-release-party) with quite a lineup of vvvv performances and more.

**Sunday**
In the evening we go to the [Grosse Konzertnacht](http://www.aec.at/totalrecall/2013/08/08/grose-konzertnacht/) in the Brucknerhaus where in recent years we already {{< user "rrrr" >}} and {{< user "woeishi" >}} playing.

**Running all days**
{{< user " shaul" >}} is involved in [Campus Exhibition: IL(L) Machine – Ars Campus Israel](http://www.aec.at/totalrecall/2013/07/29/campus-exhibition-ill-machine-ars-campus-israel/). 

{{< user " tekcor" >}} is exhibiting a version of his genome-project at [Campus Exhibition: Interface Cultures – Use at your own risk](http://www.aec.at/totalrecall/2013/07/29/campus-exhibition-interface-cultures-use-at-your-own-risk/). He also mentioned he realised an exhibit in the "Yours Sincerely" exhibition on the second floor in the AEC (the one with the barcode-scanner + postcards).

**Workshop**
On 8th and 9th (between 2 and 6pm) shaul will also host a vvvv beginner workshop. I guess it will be at Kunstuni.
