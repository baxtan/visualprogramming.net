#  Teheran annual digital art exhibition
TADAEX has been established as an annual program with a mixture of fascination, curiosity and hope to the future of contemporary art and a commitment to share, introduce and promote digital and inter-disciplinary art with the help of international platforms. 

With the support of the Goethe Institute Teheran, for the 2013 edition NODE - Forum for Digital Arts  [](http://node.vvvv.org) is one of these platforms and through this of course the vvvv world.
 
TADAEX focuses on art, science, technology and society to present the impact of art as a research and development tool for humanity in a variety of different disciplines. We believe that TADAEX can help to create a serious motivation for the young generation of artists in Iran to understand the influence of digital art movement.

#  The workshop
