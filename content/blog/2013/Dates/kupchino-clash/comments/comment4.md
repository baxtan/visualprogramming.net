nice! looking forward to this.
If I could make a wish it would be:

http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch01.html
the source files can be found here:
http://www.geisswerks.com/about_terrain.html

it has marching cubes, density fields and I would like to see how the vvvv implementation would work and how the stream out works with a mesh that is generated proceduraly.

also volumetric clouds would be extremly interesting.
