I used to live in Hackney for years near Victoria Park. But now I'm coming from Cambridge if it's happening of course. I hope enough people signup, it's a great reason to do this, I have an Oculus as well which I'll bring. Perhaps you can announce it in the shoutbox in case vvvvers haven't seen it.
