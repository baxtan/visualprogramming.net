That's sounds great Hadasi.  If I was anywhere close by would love to pop in.  Would be interesting to do a bit of a roll call at some point point to see which users are actively working with it.  

Also, if you have not already got one, get a hdmi splitter!  I picked up a really cheap one and it seems pretty invaluable for demos/workshops.
