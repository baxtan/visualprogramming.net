You might be aware of the Oculus Rift but haven't had a chance to find out what all the fuss is about. Firstly its a reasonable fuss; its the most immersive medium I've ever come across. Secondly if you'd like to try it for yourself, there's a workshop for that.

This weekend I'm putting on a couple workshops so you can get to grips with the OR in vvvv and see how your stuff looks running on it.

First I'll be going through some of the issues and and workflows I've personally come across while using it and then its over to you.

I only have one available, but I want to to make sure those who do attend can get a comprehensive idea of how to develop with it, whether this means trying trying out pre-built work, or just jamming and finding something new.

From 12 tomorrow you can book a ticket to participate:

[Saturday](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/event/8960905309) 26th Oct 12:00-15:00 
[Sunday](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/event/8958363707) 27th Oct 14:00-17:00

Please arrive on time because it will be limited, bring a computer with you, and make sure it isn't running Win 8 because it doesn't currently work with the OR plugin in vvvv, in my limited testing.

All the best,
