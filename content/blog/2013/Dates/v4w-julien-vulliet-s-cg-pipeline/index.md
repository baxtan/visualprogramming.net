![V4Wednesday Shader Night 15/01/15](Jan-15th-2013_Web.jpg) 

Most people reading this will know who Julien Vulliet is. For those who don't, run vvvv, open the node browser and type 'Vux.'

Julien's contributions have been pretty substantial, so if he spends over a year on one, its going to be special, and its going to take some explaining...

On this talk Julien will speak about graphics pipeline evolution, from Fixed Function to first Shader Pipeline,

Then will show the latest stages made available in DirectX11 and how they can be used in a diverse range of applications - generative graphics, image processing, interactive systems, speed optimizations...

Then he will show the inner workings of the pipeline and how some new techniques can be implemented in a different, cleaner and more efficient way.

Demos have been trickling out and having seen this technology in the flesh, this isn't something you'll want to miss.

Entry is free as usual, but book [here](http://v4w.eventbrite.co.uk).

Take care,

[Hadasi](http://V4Wednesday.com)
