![Habegger AcademyDays 2013](http://www.habegger.ch/uploads/tx_references/Introimage_Academy_deen3.jpg) 

As in the last two years i'll be hosting a vvvv workshop during the [Habegger AcademyDays](http://www.academydays.ch) in december. 

Have a look at their [workshop program](http://www.habegger.ch/academy/academydays13-anmeldung/details-workshops/). They have 4 full days of workshops on a range of topics covering design, management and technical stuff. 

The vvvv workshop will not be for total noobs. I will assume you have already gone through the [tutorials](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/learning/tutorials/index.html) and we'll touch more advanced topics such as shader-/plugin programming and multiscreen/boygrouping applications. Hope to see some of you there.

Ah and most likely the course will be held in german..Hier gehts zur [Anmeldung](http://www.academydays.ch).
