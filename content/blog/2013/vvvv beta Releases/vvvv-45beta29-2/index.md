{{< vimeo "59306213" >}}
this is to announce the availability of beta29.2, a maintainance release fixing mostly the most urgent troubles with beta29 that was release a bit over a month ago. just in time for [node13](http://node13.vvvv.org).

most notably problems with the midinodes should be fixed and also the problem with opening Kommunikator causing beta29 to crash is gone.

also some minor adaptions for the integration of the [dx11 stuff by vux](/blog/2012/everything-you-know) have been finished so we can all enjoy a special preview-build that {{< user "vux" >}} will provide for the workshops.

looking forward to seeing you all in frankfurt the coming week. 
yours,
devvvvs.
