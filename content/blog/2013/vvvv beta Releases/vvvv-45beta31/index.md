helohelo,

this is just a little one, mainly a maintainance release fixing problems. Probably most notable the initialisation problems with the Oculus Rift should be gone and patching in x64 builds does not stop at around 2gb..

Still we're spending it a major version number since with this release we're also introducing the long awaited copyprotection option for vvvv, see [protektor-dongle-protection-for-your-vvvv-projects](/blog/2013/protektor-dongle-protection-for-your-vvvv-projects).

Also there are new patches in:
 \girlpower\The Next Generation\Networking
in our ongoing effort to get more quality documentation on different topics out.

Ah, and the {{< node "Leap (Devices)" >}} now does gestures!
