btw. i wonder why so many cool plugins "just" end up in contributions and never get contributed to the addonpack. my guess is, the process is too complicated. 

well, at least for me, i switch the dev machine all the time, re-install windows etc. and going through the 9 steps (or more) to work on some addonpack compatible stuff is just not very compelling.

isn't there an easier way ? what about someone drops contributed plugins to the addonpack ? :)
