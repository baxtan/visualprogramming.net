Seconded.

Anyone cloning sources, and compiling it has to manually add the teamcity server or it will not find dependencies.

Your TC server tends to be less than reliable, especially while it's compiling.

Switching back and forth from alpha to beta is tedious.

But let's hear your argument: what's the rationale of having alpha dependencies on a different feed than beta dependencies?
