@velcrome: the daily builds are marked as [pre-release packages](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/versioning#Prerelease_Versions). by default visual studio shows you only the stable packages (which is 31.3.1 for now). see [this link](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/release-notes/nuget-1.7#Show_prerelease_packages_in_the_Manage_NuGet_packages_dialog) how to change that.
