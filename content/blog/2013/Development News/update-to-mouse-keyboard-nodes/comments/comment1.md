If no functionality is changed this probably means that mouse/keyboard input still won't work from non-vvvv fullscreen windows (--> "global" is not really "global"?)

E.g. having vvvv in the background as a "do-something-in-the-background-central".
I created a "real" global keyboard hook some time ago (for the vvvv-Unity-connection I was showing at NODE13), because built-in "Keyboard Global" didn't receive keys from fullscreen Unity.
I just uploaded it to contributions: {{< contribution "global-keyhook" >}}
