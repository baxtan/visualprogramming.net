Announcing a random new feature: ctrl+F10 to toggle debugging spreadcounts

A link can have any of 4 styles:
* dotted: when carrying ø
* normal: when carrying 1 slice
* thin: when carrying a slicecount less than half of the patchs maximum spreadcount
* thick: when carrying a slicecount greater then half of the patchs maximum spreadcount
* fat: when carrying the patchs maximum spreadcount

We hope this to be specifically usefull when teaching beginners about spreads or hunting for large spreads or ø.
