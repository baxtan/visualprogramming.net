suggestion: can we have the absolute raw data coming from the mouse? i mean currently when i set the source to "raw" it is clamped between -1 and 1 (even when i set it to "CycleIncrement" mode
yeah after viewing the source code of mouse nodes that clamp in "raw" mode is completely unnecessary in my opinion. if somebody wants to clamp it between -1 and 1 let them do it in the patch.
