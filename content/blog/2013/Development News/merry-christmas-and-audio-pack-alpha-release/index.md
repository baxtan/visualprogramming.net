As promised [a year ago](/blog/2012/vvvv45beta29) there are no more vvvv releases on the 24th of december.

But that does not stop any of us to release stuff on the 25th of december.
With great pleasure the first alpha preview of the new vvvv audio engine is here in the beloved vvvv-pack format. The focus of the engine was not so much DSP programming but flexible signal routing for large scale installations and VST support: {{< contribution "vvvv.audio-pack-alpha" >}}

But that's not all, the latest addonpack contains all of {{< user "bjoern" >}}s {{< contribution "combinatorics-nodes" "combinatorics nodes" >}}. They should give you quite some fun when working with indices.

And here is a little x-mas amateur demo video of the audio engine:

Have some nice holidays with the new toys!

And be aware, its [windows only](forum)!

your,
devvvvs
