...and a happy new year!

Already save the date: [The NODE Institute](https://thenodeinstitute.org) has announced that there'll be a **vvvv meetup on January 12th**! 

And also over at The NODE Institute the following webinars are coming up in January:
- January 11: [Châtaigne and vvvv: Powering Multimedia Installations](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ws23-vvvv-06-powering-multimedia-installations-with-chataigne-and-vvvv/) by [Seb Escudié](https://sebescudie.github.io/)
- January 18: [From Dataset to Dataviz: Mastering Data Visualization](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ws23-vvvv-07-mastering-data-visualization-in-vvvv-gamma/) by [Katharina Mayrhofer](https://www.katharinamayrhofer.net/wp/)
- January 25: [Sequencers and Clocks](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ws23-vvvv-08-create-sequencers-and-precise-clock-based-tools-in-vvvv-gamma/) by [Arístides García](https://www.aristidesgarcia.de/)

And there'll be even [more in February](https://thenodeinstitute.org/winter-season-23/)!

But before we divvvve deeper into 2024, here is a final review for last year:

- Minor breaking change: We now have [support for GPU< RGBA>](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/add-feature-to-annotate-computefloat4-as-color/21591/5) which means when using latest 5.3 previews you'll also need to update to latest VL.Addons and VL.Fuse
- We've massively improved debugging in vvvv. Read all about it in [Debug Views](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/introducing-debug-views/) 
- We've released an initial version of [VL.MediaPipe](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.MediaPipe), read more about it in [this forum entry](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-mediapipe/22194)

Oh and two suggestions:
- If you need some patching practice: [Genuary](https://genuary.art/) is currently running and encourages you to build and share little beautiful things following their [prompts](https://genuary.art/prompts)
- Watch this Introduction to FUSE, the clever GPU patching library:
