Here goes another month,

and with it came another release: **vvvv gamma 6.4** is out! Please consult [the change log](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/6.x.html) for details and the download.

While we're continuing with fixes here and there and should have another release following shortly, we're also working on new core features: The big one is still "Global Channels" and all its many facets. Hoping to be able to show one of those things this month... And we have finally started work on a the long-awaited session-management, allowing you to save editor/extension bounds and then some more. Exciting weeks ahead...
