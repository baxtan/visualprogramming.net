## Learning vvvv


And, July comes with even **more FUSE**!

For the coming weeks, The NODE Institute's [vvvv intermediate workshops](https://thenodeinstitute.org/ss24-vvvv-intermediates/) have a strong focus on the [FUSE libraray](https://www.thefuselab.io/).

Here is what you can learn in June:
* July 4: [Compute Shader with FUSE](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss24-vvvv-compute-shader-with-fuse/)
* July 11: [Working with particles in FUSE](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss24-vvvv-working-with-particles-in-fuse/)
* July 18: [Fluid simulations in FUSE](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss24-vvvv-fluid-simulations-in-fuse/)

You can also still get [the FUSE bundle](https://thenodeinstitute.org/product/vvvv-intermediates-summer-2024-fuse-bundle/) to get access to all 8 sessions at a discount.
