Oh dears,

this past month we gave you not one, but two releases! Check the [changelog of vvvv gamma 6.x](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/6.x.html) and make sure to update to 6.3 soon. 

We finally managed to have another meetup and you can rewatch it here: [24. vvvv worldwide meetup](https://www.youtube.com/live/gNszIiRAjDo?si=OlReiYsfyIBEnZFL)

And it is happening again: Join us for the 3rd edition of [LINK - the vvvv summercamp 2024](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2024/link-the-vvvv-summer-camp-24/). The best place for beginners and experts alike to deepen their vvvv and swimming skills.

## Learning vvvv
