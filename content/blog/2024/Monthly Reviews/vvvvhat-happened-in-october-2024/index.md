Ohwheee,

were to start.. So we had another meetup this month and if you haven't already, you may want to [rewatch it here](https://www.youtube.com/live/MdvTa58uxB0).

The VST3 support as [briefly demoed at the meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdvTa58uxB0&t=3600s) has already made huge progress. Hoping we'll be able to show something by the end of this month...

Kicked off through a priority support inquiry by Emanuele Foti, we added [support for RPLidar devices by Slamtec](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2024/introducing-support-for-rplidar-devices-by-slamtec/).

Some more things are hopefully finally seeing the light of the day within November. Stay tuned...

## Learning vvvv

Here is your current best opportunity for getting started with vvvv via courses run by [The NODE Institute](https://thenodeinstitute.org/):
