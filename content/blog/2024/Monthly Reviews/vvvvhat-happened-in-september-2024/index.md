Autumn leavvvves...

..and a lot of things are brewing that should ideally all become visible within the coming months, before the end of this year. But they're still too early to talk about. Bummer...

Let's see what we do have though:
- Not entirely new, but finally available in a stable NuGet: [Support for ZED stereo cameras by Stereolabs](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2024/introducing-support-for-zed-stereo-cameras-by-stereolabs/)
- Work on a VST host has started and we're happy to have this development sponsored in parts by long-time vvvv power users [m-box](https://www.m-box.de/), [SCHNELLE BUNTE BILDER](https://schnellebuntebilder.de/) and [3e8.studio](http://3e8.studio/)
- Also in the works is support for RPLidar's A-series by [Slamtec](https://www.slamtec.com/), sponsored by Emanuele Foti
- And we haven't mentioned here yet that we have an ARM-build brewing for optimal performance on those types of processors. More on this later..
- Ongoing is further work on: Global Channels, Presets, Bindings, Transitions

And these are only the tip of the iceberg... please bare with us!
