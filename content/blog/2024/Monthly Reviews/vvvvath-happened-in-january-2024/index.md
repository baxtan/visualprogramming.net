 The NODE Institute has the following workshops are lined up for February:
- February 18th: [Exploring VL.Stride for 3d graphics rendering](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ws23-vvvv-10-exploring-vl-stride-for-3d-graphics-rendering-in-vvvv/) by [Randall Vásquez](https://github.com/ravazquez)
- February 15th: [SuperCollider Integration for Sonic Explorations](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ws23-vvvv-11-supercollider-integration-for-sonic-explorations-in-vvvv-gamma/) by [Christoph Ignaz Kirmaier](https://vimeo.com/threeeeight/)
- February 22nd: [Unlocking Shader Artistry: A Journey through ‘The Book of Shaders’](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ws23-vvvv-12-book-of-shaders/) by [Vincent Nowak](https://discourse.vvvv.org/u/vincent.now/summary)
- February 29th: [Create Sequencers and Precise Clock Based Tools](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ws23-vvvv-08-create-sequencers-and-precise-clock-based-tools-in-vvvv-gamma/) by [Arístides García](https://www.aristidesgarcia.de/)

here are some updated:
- Think multiple overlapping projections that you need to align, softedge, color correct, here is the [Projector Calibration by Scalable Display Technologies](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/introducing-projector-calibration-by-scalable-display-technologies/)
- vvvv gamma 6.x is [.NET8, C# 12](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/updates-net8-csharp12-stride4.2/)
- We've released an initial version of [VL.MediaPipe](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.MediaPipe), read more about it in [this forum entry](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-mediapipe/22194)

and a suggestion for conference lovers:
-  [vvvv at BASTA! Frankfurt](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/vvvv-at-basta-frankfurt/) with vvvv gamma being a much more general development environment it feels like there should be areas outside of multimedia where vvvv can shine! here is the session [ vvvv - Eine visuelle Echtzeit-Programmierumgebung für .NET](https://basta.net/net-framework-c/vvv-visuelle-echtzeit-programmierumgebung-dotnet/)
