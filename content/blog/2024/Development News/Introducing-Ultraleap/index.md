Dear trackers of hands,

we're happy to announce that we now have support for the latest handtracking devices by [Ultraleap](https://www.ultraleap.com/). Tested to work with both their Gemini (5.20) and Hyperion (6.0) line of drivers.

*"We remove boundaries between physical and digital worlds - for anyone, anywhere. [..]   Our hand tracking and haptics are powering the next wave of human potential. No controllers. No wearables. No touchscreens. Just natural interaction."* 

...and now available as an easily deployable option for your interactive vvvv projects!

Based on their [Plugin for Unity](https://github.com/ultraleap/UnityPlugin) we've created the [VL.Devices.Ultraleap](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Devices.Ultraleap) package, implementing a node-set for you to quickly access the features available through the SDK.
