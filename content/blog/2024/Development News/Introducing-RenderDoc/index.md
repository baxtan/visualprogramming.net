# RenderDoc for vvvv gamma

[RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) support has been added to [VL.Stride](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.StandardLibs/tree/main/VL.Stride) for vvvv gamma `preview 6.7-199` and later. This simplifies GPU and shader debugging, making it easier to capture and analyze GPU calls and shaders in larger projects.

## Key Features

RenderDoc enables inspection of the graphics pipeline for captured frames. It features texture, buffer and mesh views per draw call and even allows line-by-line shader debugging with value inspection.

### RenderDocManager Node

Integrates with RenderDoc, controlling frame capture directly in vvvv. RenderDoc can then inspect the frames for GPU debugging.

### `--debug-gpu` Flag

vvvv must be started with this command-line flag to enable RenderDocâ€™s GPU capture functionality. It enables the debug features of the graphics device and helps gather detailed GPU information.

### Why Use It?

This tool is essential for debugging complex shaders or performance issues related to GPU operations. It removes much of the guesswork by providing a detailed view of GPU processes. Combined with RenderDoc's powerful analysis features and the Stride Profiler, it makes troubleshooting faster and more accurate, especially in graphics-heavy projects.

### How to Use

There is a dedicated [documentation page](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/libraries/3d/gpu-debugging.html) in The Gray Book with all the details.
