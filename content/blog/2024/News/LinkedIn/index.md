There you have it,

![](LinkedIn-Blue-96@2x.png)

we present to you: vvvv's shiny new [storefont on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vvvv-group).

With access to that little walled garden, please help us spread the word! You can do so by:
- Following the page
- Using the tag #vvvv in your LinkedIn posts when you share related content so we can find and potentially repost it
- Adding vvvv as your skill via the product pages of [vvvv beta](https://www.linkedin.com/products/vvvv-group-vvvv-beta/) and [vvvv gamma](https://www.linkedin.com/products/vvvv-group-vvvv-gamma/)

In case you're lucky and your view to the storefront is blocked by a log-in wall, fret not, you're not going to miss out! As a reminder, the best ways to stay up-to-date with vvvv are still:

- Follow [this very blog via RSS](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/index.xml)
- Follow us [vvvv on Mastodon](https://mastodon.xyz/)
- Subscribe to [the newsletter](https://visualprogramming.net/#contact)

Happy following!
