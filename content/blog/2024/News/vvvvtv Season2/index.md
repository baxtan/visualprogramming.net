Loooong overdue, vvvvTv is back! 

Renewed for Seaons 2, we're committed to serving you a series of new episodes going forward. 

Here is the Season 2 pilot:

In this episode we talk about a quick way of reading sensor data into and controlling motors from vvvv. We demo this using an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) board running the [Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/arduino) firmware, which means that there is no coding required on the arduino side. When you know how to connect things to the Arduino, you'll see how it takes just a view clicks in vvvv to interact with them. 

## What the vvvvTv?

vvvvTv is our live channel to tell you everything we know about vvvv. In every episode we dive into a different corner of vvvv to shed some light on it. Demoing new and unearthing old features, giving an overview of individual libraries, discussing coding patterns and techniques. 

Looking forward to your feedback, thoughts and remarks. Hoping to make this into a useful resource for your path forward, learning vvvv.
