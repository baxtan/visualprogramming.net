Hello vvvvorld!

I am excited to announce an upcoming short webinar that will showcase the integration between Rhino and vvvv, opening up new horizons for dynamic and interactive 3D experiences and workflows.

In this webinar you'll learn essential techniques, including .3dm file support, utilizing user strings for informed geometry, and ensuring smooth integration of material properties between [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com) and vvvv.

## What will I learn?

Rhino, known for its versatility in architecture, industrial design, and visualization, can now seamlessly connect with vvvv, unlocking new possibilities for dynamic and interactive 3D experiences.

In this webinar, you'll learn how to harness the full potential of Rhino when paired with vvvv. Discover how to bridge the gap between precise 3D modeling and real-time visual programming through the exclusive features of the VL.Rhino3dm library.

We'll guide you through essential techniques, including .3dm file support, using user strings for informed geometry, and ensuring smooth integration of material properties between Rhino and vvvv. By the end of the session, you'll have a solid understanding of how to enhance your Rhino workflow with real-time interactivity and visualization, making your 3D models more dynamic and expressive. 

This Webinar will be more of an introduction for the Rhino Community, showing the possibilities coming with vvvv.
