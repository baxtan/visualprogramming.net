Devvvvelopers!

As part of our ongoing mission of bringing the joys of developing with vvvv to a wider audience we're eying at the .NET community. While vvvv historically certainly has a focus on all things *interactive media*, with vvvv gamma being a much more general development environment it feels like there should be areas outside of *multimedia* where vvvv can shine.

So let's see who we can convince to have a look at vvvv when we introduce it at this years [BASTA! Die Konferenz für .NET, Windows & Open Innovation](https://basta.net/frankfurt/) in Frankfurt.

The session: [vvvv - Eine visuelle Echtzeit-Programmierumgebung für .NET](https://basta.net/net-framework-c/vvv-visuelle-echtzeit-programmierumgebung-dotnet/)

Not for you? Most likely, but forward this to your nerdier aunts and uncles, they might be curious!
