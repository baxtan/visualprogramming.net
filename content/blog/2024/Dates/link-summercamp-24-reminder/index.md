**Hiii folkss!**

If you are still thinking about joining us at LINK, you should stop thinking and register soon, the **deadline is the 4th of August**. :P

Here is what participants at this year LINK have told us, maybe that will convince you:

- "Some ugmented reality stuff please ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘ˆ :)"
- "A campfire!"
- "I wanna meet many other colleagues and find ways to collaborate with!"
- "I can give some vvvv teaching. We could make a vj lesson and let everybody vj on a party night"
- "i like to sing and dance, and patch"

I donÂ´t know about you, but to us that sounds like a wonderful time!

Also, if you already have topics you are interested in learning/working on or something you want to show, please **leave a comment to this post** with some information for the other participants!

After the deadline is over, you will recieve an email with further information concerning the arrival/departure, a rough schedule and everything else you might need to know :D

Furthermore, have a look at the [website](https://link-summercamp.de/information/) for general information, it will be updated in the next days!
