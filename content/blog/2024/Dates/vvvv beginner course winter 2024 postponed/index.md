We are keeping the registration for the next edition of the vvvv beginner course open for another four weeks - scheduled every Monday evening from 6-9 pm, starting on November 4th. 

For us this was also a good chance to finally split the course into two parts which we call "Playground" and "Deep Dive". So in case you are just starting with vvvv and want to extend your artistic toolset or try something new, join us for part I. But if you already have some knowledge under your belt, want to learn more about the language methodologies of VL and how to build more complex applications, you may also join the second part of the course.

## What will I learn?

The course covers all you need to know to start your vvvv career and enter specific intermediate or advanced topics. In 12 sessions you will learn the basics of programming in vvvv and creating real time renderings, audio and data visualizations, creative coding algorithms, best practices in structuring your applications, building user interfaces and object-oriented patching in VL.

## Who is it for?

- Artists who find inspiration in nature, animation and technology
- Technologists who are searching for a multipurpose toolkit for interactive installations
- Architects and designers who want to learn new ways of visualising their ideas
- Developers who are annoyed by coding and want to try visual programming instead
