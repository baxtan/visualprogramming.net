Schmiede is 20 this year!

The place that brought many vvvv users together over the past years has something to celebrate. And you can be part of it!

Haven't heard of [Schmiede](https://schmiedehallein.com) yet? Here is in their own words:

{{< box >}}
Schmiede is the playground of ideas, a cooperative prototyping environment, focused on the arts, hacking and entrepreneurship. Schmiede is the place where our ideas come to play.

Since 2003, once a year, for ten days we come together in Hallein to network create and present. We are the Smiths, SchmiedeParticipants and extended family.
