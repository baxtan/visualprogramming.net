We’re meeting on **Friday November 11th 8pm CET**! The meetup will take place live in Berlin. However, participants can also take part remotely from anywhere in the world.

It is a place to meet and exchange ideas and experiences with other users and the development team.  The meetup is open to anyone who wants to join, no matter if you are a vvvv expert or beginner, a famous or breadless artists, a designhead or technologist, a piano player or techno musician.

We are especially open for newcomers and curious beginners and we try to make this meetup as diverse as possible but with a focus on vvvv and VL.  The meetup follows the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org). 

Confirmed contributions so far:
- Natan Sinigaglia (dottore) giving an update on Kairos
- vvvv group giving updates on latest developments of vvvv
