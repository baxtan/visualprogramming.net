We’re meeting on **Thursday July 7th 8pm CET**! The meetup will take place live in Berlin. However, participants can also take part remotely from anywhere in the world.

It is a place to meet and exchange ideas and experiences with other users and the development team.  The meetup is open to anyone who wants to join, no matter if you are a vvvv expert or beginner, a famous or breadless artists, a designhead or technologist, a piano player or techno musician.

We are especially open for newcomers and curious beginners and we try to make this meetup as diverse as possible but with a focus on vvvv and VL.  The meetup follows the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org). 

Confirmed contributions so far:
- Natan Sinigaglia (dottore) giving an update his contributions
- vvvv group giving updates on latest developments of vvvv

##  Want to share your work?
Please do! Anything more or less related to vvvv, yourself and your projects. Share some thoughts, share your funny fails. Or just join and vibe with us… just drop us a line: meetup@vvvv.org

## Do I need to know vvvv or VL to join this meetup?

No, absolutely not. The presentations will be about projects, patches, plugins, contributions, or simple add ons made with or for vvvv, but you do not need to know it to enjoy the meetup.

## What is going on at this meetup?

You come, grab a drink and listen. You grab the next drink and talk. We have one or two announced presentations followed by one or two spontaneous presentations by anyone who brought something to show… The focus should be in the processes, the decisions and the mistakes that occur during the development of an idea. Submissions are welcome. Please drop us a line.
