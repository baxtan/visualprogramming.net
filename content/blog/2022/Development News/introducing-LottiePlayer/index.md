Dear animators!

Have you heard of [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/what-is-lottie)? It is a vector based animation format that you can now play back in vvvv. So rather than heavy movie files, think small size and quasi endless resolution. 

Watch this brief demo from our last meetup:

## Create your own

Initially created for exporting Adobe After Effects animations using the [Bodymovin](https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/) plugin, the Lottie format can meanwhile also be exported by a few other tools, like e.g. [Framer](https://www.framer.com/plugins/lottie/). For a full list of supporting applications, see [Lottie Creation Tools](https://github.com/LottieFiles/awesome-lottie#Creation-Tools).

## Marketplace 

For certain usecases it may even be suitable to just get some stock animations. If this sounds interesting, have a look at the  [marketplace for Lottie files](https://lottiefiles.com/marketplace) where you can buy and sell ready to use Lotties.

Interested? You can test-drive this right away by downloading the latest available [vvvv gamma preview](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download).

Happy animating!
