Latest:

We have a new release: [vvvv gamma 2021.4.10](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2021.4.html) with quite a changelog!

For the professional projectionists among you we have a special treat: vvvv now supports [VIOSO's Projector Autocalibration](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2022/introducing-vioso-projector-warping-and-blending/).

We had a meetup a few weeks ago, which you can still [rewatch here](https://youtu.be/nwSZ-OFDoC0).

Further on our current agenda:
- Work on wrapping [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) into a convenient set of nodes is making good progress
- On the [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/OpenXR/) front we just had success getting handtracking to work for Quest2 devices... 
- Our efforts continue to making vvvv a premium tool for all things projection mapping. You can follow our progress with the [VL.Badmapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Badmapper) NuGet. Still to be announced properly!
- We're investigating performance/memory issues that have been reported and are testing strategies to optimize things
- Still sorting out some issues with the switch to .NET6. This delays the announcement of previews for the upcoming 2022.5 release. Currently scheduled for end of August
