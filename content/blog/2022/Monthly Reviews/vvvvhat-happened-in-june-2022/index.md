We have a **meetup on July 7th**, see [18th worldwide meetup](../../Dates/18-vvvv-woldwide-meetup).

And then you want to know what's happening under the hood? Quite a lot these days. Here is an incomplete list:

- We've started work on wrapping [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) into a convenient set of nodes. Best read [The ImGui Pitch](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui#the-pitch) to understand what to expect and also what not
- Work has finished on providing basic [OpenXR](https://www.khronos.org/OpenXR/) support for Stride. Waiting for the PR to be accepted so we can ship that with vvvv
- We're consolidating IO libraries SerialPort, TCP, WebSocket, ZMQ and MQTT to standardize and simplify their usage
- The NodeBrowser is getting a simpler mode for choosing overloads
- Need projector auto-alignment for one of your projects? We have you covered. If you're interested, [please get in touch](mailto:devvvvs@vvvv.org) and we can see if it will work for your project, even before we publish the packs for everyone to try
- The still to be announced .NET6 branch is getting an option to work with precompiled .vl documents (think: speed and resource improvements during patching)

## Contributions
We got two new ones:
* [VL.Stride.Text3d](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Stride.Text3d)

Still cooking are these two pull requests for VL.Stride:

* [Geometry Primitives](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.Stride/pull/561)

aaand [tobyk](https://vvvv.org/users/tobyk) created a [vvvv tutorial](https://youtu.be/RXDRfqLbc74) that looks like it could become a bit of a series...
