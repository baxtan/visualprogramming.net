Where to start...

We have a fresh [2021.4.9 release](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2021.4.html) out!

On the .NET6 front we gave a little preview: A first build of a [vvvv patch running on a Raspberry Pi](https://mastodon.xyz/@vvvv/108294396860106198). More on this in a separate blogpost soonâ„¢.

In projection mapping news (also still pending a separate blogpost): We've implemented two different projector auto-alignment systems for your professional projection mapping needs. Still too early to be publish, but if you're interested, [please get in touch](mailto:devvvvs@vvvv.org) and we can see if it will work for your project.

We've now brought the whole blog archive going back to 2005 over to this new blog. Search is yet to come, but you'll see that already using "Categories" and "Years" to browse by makes it quite easy to navigate.
