Happy new evvvveryone!

It's that time of the year again where we're throwing out the old one and are unconditionally happy for yet another one to come. That's the spirit! So while you mentally prepare for the upcoming meetup on January 25th, you have a chance to rewatch the [15th vvvv online meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxpaJjaJg_o), the last one from 2021.

Last thing in December for us was releasing another dot-release for the 2021.4 series of vvvv gamma. Changes and download for it can be found [in the usual place](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2021.4.html).

And here's to all educators among you:
With vvvv gamma finally being in proper shape, we're starting an educational offensive. First off, we're running a super-spreader event with a course tailored to educators. For full details and application, please see:
