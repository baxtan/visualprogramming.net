The future is near!

We're progressing well on the promised upgrade to .NET6 and will have a preview plus a blogpost on what this all means, available for you soonâ„¢.

Further work is happening on our next generation projection mapping library. Could this make vvvv gamma the  number-one-go-to-tool for all things projection mapping? You be the judge!

And then some more too early to talk about. Stay tuned! And go outside when the sun is shining!
