This time of the month again,

where we wrap up the recent happenings. Grab a drink, here goes:
* 2021.4.11 with a focus on stability and performance improvements is now available for testing in [latest previews](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download). 
* Biggest thing in the making currently is the upcoming 2022.5 release which is now also [available for testing](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2022/vvvv-gamma-2022.5-previews-available-now/).
* Thanks to a sponsorship by [wirmachenbunt](https://wirmachenbunt.de/) we made some improvements to the VL.Devices.AzureKinect pack (PointCloudEntity, BodyIds, Timestamps, multi-device sync)
* Thanks to a sponsorship by [Refik Anadol Studios](https://refikanadolstudio.com/) we've reworked VL.IO.NDI which now comes with stable versions for sending both skia and stride textures

Oh and if you're looking for a little push to experiment with vvvv, consider joining [Nodevember](https://nodevember.io/), which coincidentally is also a perfect opportunity to test [the new Show & Tell feature](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2022/introducing-show-tell/):
