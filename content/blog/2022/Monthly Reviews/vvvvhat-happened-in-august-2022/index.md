And there goes August, 

a month that saw quite some holiday action on our end. Still we found time for a few things I'm happy to fill you in about:

- [Support for Lottie animations](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2022/introducing-lottie) has finally landed in preview builds
- Also in latest previews is a new commandline `--nuget-path` as discussed in [this forum post](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vvvv-projects-self-contained-vs-global-package-repositories/20754/12)
- After identifying the issue, work has started to mitigate framedrops as mentioned in [this forum post](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/total-frame-drop-out-including-audio-dropout-glitching/20701)
- We're about to finish work on the [Geometry Primitives](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.Stride/pull/561) pullrequest and hope to soon have it merged into latest previews
- We further continued work on wrapping [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and on our projection mapping library [VL.Badmapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Badmapper)
- Work is well under way moving [Contributions](https://legacy.vvvv.org/contributions) into a new home...
- We sat with the [FUSE](https://www.thefuselab.io/) team to figure out best practices for their next steps 
  
Next up: We're looking forward to the **[Kairos development camp 1.0
](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-kairos/15506)** mid of September. Looking forward to see you there!
