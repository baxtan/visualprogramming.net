Evvvveryone!

This is the final post on this blog. In our steady effort to transition to a new website, we're herby moving the blog to a shiny new place:

![](newblog.jpg)

**[https://visualprogramming.net/blog](https://visualprogramming.net/blog)**

So please point your RSS reader to this new URL. Also, we're still hoping to bring most of the archived posts over to the new blog to have them all in one place again. So please bear with us...

## Comments
Again, your comments on blog-posts are very much appreciated. Be it anonymously or preferably logged in with your element (matrix) chat user. How this works? We're using the amazing [Cactus Comments](https://cactus.chat/docs/getting-started/introduction/) for this.

Every blog-post essentially has a corresponding chat room in the matrix and thus you can also comment and track notifications there as you prefer. For an overview of all blog-comment rooms, join this space:

**[vvvv blog comments](https://matrix.to/#/#vvvv-blog-comments:matrix.org)**

## Guest Posts
We do accept guest posts! If you want to announce a vvvv-related event, technology or project, please go ahead and send us a pull-request to [the repo of the website](https://github.com/vvvv/visualprogramming.net).

Specifically, blog-posts go here: 

  https://github.com/vvvv/visualprogramming.net/tree/master/content/blog

Formatting is in markdown and you'd have a look at some of the other blog-posts to see how it all goes. Looking forward to your contributions!
