Already!

1/12th into the new year and here is what you may have missed so far:

* We have a new stable release out, see: [vvvv gamma 6.7](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/6.x.html#vvvv-gamma-67) 
* Latest previews include preview of a new feature "Snapping" that helps with clean patching
* A first preview is out for [VL.Devices.Orbbec](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Devices.Orbbec) supporting their latest Gemini and Femto devices. Development sponsored by [Supply and Deamnd](https://supply-demand.ca/)
* We made good progress on the previously announced avateering front. Still some patches to go though...
* The website got a much needed re-unification. You'll now find forum, store, thegraybook under the same unified header. Next: Bringing back user/edu/company profiles

And also the [26th worldwide online meetup](https://www.youtube.com/live/uRVZlBzfHjU?si=8YnVkSx05OpJJYZE) happened with many great presentations!
