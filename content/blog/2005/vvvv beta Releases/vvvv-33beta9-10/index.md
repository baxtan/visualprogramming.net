this is to inform you of our latest and greatest. 

3 years and still beta?! well yes. this is a serious busyness to do. bear with us, we will get there. here is the short story of what is new for this release:

* multimonitor support is greatly improved. still not perfect but on its way.. 
* deinterlacing via videotexture finally seems to work smoothly with only 2 frames delay from the input. 
* the new ColorTracker is not yet spreadable but still great and only part of what is still to come in that field..
* with SetPatch (VVVV) we introduce another complete universe. be sure to check its helppatch.

may this help you during the upcomming boring days. 
so patch yourself and gut keks.
santa boys.
