Main subject of our diploma thesis is to determine to which extent a dataflow graph is suitable for building complex web server applications in an intuitive way. It might sound a little diffuse, but for you, it’ll result into a straightforward bunch of new nodes. Finally there will be two new node categories: XML and HTTP Server. While the HTTP Server allows to serve (X)HTML strings to the WWW, the XML Nodes open a huge field of creating and respectively transforming those strings. The HTTP Server is split into two nodes: Server & Receiver. The receiver throws out HTTP Requests, now you can let server serve request-depending strings. You can already try the first set of new nodes with beta9.2. 

We’ve created a diploma page with the current state of our work. Later we will provide example modules as well as tutorials for the XML Stuff on that site. [diploma page](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/devvvveloping/diplomas/diplomas.html)
