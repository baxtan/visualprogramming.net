Modeling physical material more freely and making it move more flexibly is a dream long sought after by human beings, and many artists have created surreal illusions in pictures or moving images. Can we obtain a real object that transforms as we designed it? Protrude, flow is an interactive installation which expresses the dynamics of fluid motion of physical material, the dynamics of organic, wild shapes and movements of liquid by means of digital computer control. Protrude, flow uses magnetic fluid, sound, and moving images.
