no idea what one would really use this for. so just for the memo:

[SwiftShader](http://www.transgaming.com/business/swiftshader/) provides developers with an ultra-high-performance software renderer that is suitable for use in a wide variety of applications, ranging from games to embedded systems applications. The SwiftShader rendering engine is able to execute complex vertex and pixel shaders, allowing for quality levels never before available in a high performance software renderer.

basically seems to work with vvvv.
