[WikipediaClassAction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikipediaClassAction) *"is currently gathering complaints from the entire Internet community, including individuals, corporations, partnerships, etc., who believe that they have been defamed and or who have been or are the subject of anonymous and malicious postings to the popular online encyclopedia WikiPedia."*

in  order to

*# Force Wikimedia Foundation Inc., through legal action, to change its current practices that permit anyone to post content to their website, without formal attribution and without recourse back to Wikimedia Foundation and or the author of the content;*

*# Recover substantial monetary damages, on behalf of those who have suffered as a direct result of Wikimedia's flawed business model;*

*# Establish a precedent that will ensure similar websites are held responsible for their content;*

In other words, they want to sue the internet, abolish anonymity, and undermine any collaborative non-profit efforts. hm. Time to go underground, perhaps.
