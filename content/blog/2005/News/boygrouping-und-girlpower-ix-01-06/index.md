there's a very nice article about vvvv in the latest iX-magazine. 

watch out for "Boygrouping und Girlpower", a 5 page long article about our beloved software from the perspective of "industrial system clients"(?)

in fact a very sweet introduction into vvvv with the approach to get around this sometimes loose toolbox and just a more practical way to describe it.

Yipee!
