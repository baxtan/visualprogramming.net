Check the [Users](https://legacy.vvvv.org/users/) page. It is thought to be the place to all different user activities. 

First of all there are links to all the userpages and then there are links to all the places where users can talk about their work and also are able to place some news in the blog. because often there are interesting things in the shoutbox and the next day they're gone. In the blog we could place links to all different stuff, like interesting devices and software or links to new wikipages...
Then the community page also links to all downloadable stuff from the users.
