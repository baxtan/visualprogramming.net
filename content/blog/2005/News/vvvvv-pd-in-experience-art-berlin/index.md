The exhibition "Experience Art! - fascination art and technology" shows selected works in the fields new media art, cinetic art, cybernetic art, interactive sound and video installations are represented.
My partner Giovanni Longo and I, Peggy Sylopp are art directors of the exhibition.

Beside works of renowned joint founders of the media arts such as Sound Wall (Peter Vogel), Talking Machine (Martin Riches), Breathing Suitcases (Benoit Maubrey) and the Flamenco Magnetico - robots (Nicolas A.Baginsky), there is also the work of young talents, for example Camera Lucida (Dmitry Gelfand and Evelina Domnitch), Sonobotanic Plants (Marije Baalman) and Metaforms (Tim Coe).

Also shown is my installation Crackling Water: the visitors watch a video installation and are filmed by a camera at the same time.  Their motion causes bubbles to appear on the video in realtime.
For the realization I implemented the motion detection of pd in combination with wave simualtion of vvvv.
