parutiful: &quot;The [reactive cube](http://grahamplumb.com/cube.html), like a piece of paper or computer monitor screen is a form of visual medium. It is a more visceral kind of screen, designed to transform digital images into apparently physical objects. It works by projecting a two dimensional image through a three dimensional mass - in this case water mixed with a specially formulated emulsion. The emulsion is composed of micron-sized particles of oil formulated to stay suspended in water. The projected light is captured by the oil and appears to become a virtually real object.&quot;
