Here is!

The first bug-fix release for vvvv gamma is available for **[download](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download)** and **[purchase](https://store.vvvv.org)** now!

The highlight of this release is the updated helpbrowser which makes it even easier to find help. It now allows you to search for terms across all different types of help content.

*Searching for a term now shows you available content across all types of help*
Want to know more about the different types of help the helpbrowser is offering? Here we're trying to follow the excellent suggestions we found in: [The documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/). A must-read for anyone interested in the topic of documentation!

For the full list of changes, see the[Log of Changes](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2020.1.html).

Happy patching!
