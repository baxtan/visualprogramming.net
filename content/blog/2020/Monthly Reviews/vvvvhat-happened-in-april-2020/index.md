Here we are now,

vvvv beta just got a [bugfix 39.1 release](/blog/2020/vvvv50beta39.1). Nothing big, just getting rid of some annoyances and preparing for the upcoming beta40 which will include latest VL! 

We're a month after the initial release of our [revvvvolution in visual live-programming](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2020.1-release). We got [some nice feedback on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22753890), {{< user "noobusdeer" >}} and {{< user "yar" >}} are running a [weekly series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG41Vm1E3_1QVu_rorgQ8ag) (in Russian) about it, {{< user "domj" >}} started a [therapy session](https://therapy.domj.net) for it and i believe that all the webinars we ran so far were quite well received. This is why we have some more upcoming:

**[vvvv gamma webinars in May](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-webinars-in-may)**

It seems the initial release of vvvv gamma also runs quite stable so far. We haven't heard of any showstopper buggers, which allows us to already prepare the upcoming releases. We've outlined our next steps on the [roadmap](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/roadmap.html) page. 

Most heavy lifting at the moment is happening towards wrapping VL.Stride into an easily usable 3d engine for everyone. Still hard to make any predictions regarding a preview release, but we hope to at least be able to show some progress soon. 

So you see, we're far from bored...In case you are, here are two things for you to watch: 
* The [recording of my intro to vvvv gamma](https://youtu.be/SG65AaOksFk) talk I held at Ircam some weeks ago where I'm also casually using VL.Stride already...
* The [recording of the 2. worldwide vvvv meetup](https://youtu.be/uczIZHGHUlg?t=219) from last week with many nice goodies being presented...

And finally, if you need a vvvv specialist or are one yourself, check out this new listing of [vvvv specialists available for hire](https://legacy.vvvv.org/documentation/vvvv-specialists-available-for-hire).
