So where were we...

...right, we just released [vvvv gamma 2020.1.3](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2020.1.3-release), the 3rd bug-fix release. Before that, we saw some impressive work by {{< user "idwyr" >}}, {{< user "ravel" >}} and {{< user "andresc4" >}} at the last [worldwide meetup](https://youtu.be/pa3HRQ7kj6w). 

And all the time we're still heavily concentrating on VL.Stride, where we're making good progress and hope we can have at least some more demos out soon, before, obviously, we can't wait to give it into your hands. Meanwhile, the best way for you to prepare for its arrival is to make sure you feel comfortable with vvvv gamma. For which we have prepared a series of:

**[vvvv gamma webinars in June](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-webinars-in-june)**

If those are not enough, be sure to not miss the weekly [vvvv gamma therapy sessions](https://therapy.domj.net) run by {{< user "domj" >}}.

But VL.Stride is not the only thing that is cooking: The last weeks we've also put a lot of effort into providing first-class support for depth cameras: Kinect v1, Kinect2, Azure Kinect, Orbbec Astra, Intel RealSense, the Nuitrack API and the Ultraleap Motion. Expect a separate blogpost and non-prerelease nugets for those soon...

Next step according to the [roadmap](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/roadmap.html) is improving networking...
