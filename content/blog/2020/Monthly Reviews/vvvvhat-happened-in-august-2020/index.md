Swoooosh,

and another month has passed... We're happily running the [VL.Stride EarlyAccess program](/blog/2020/vl.stride-earlyaccess-available-now) and at this point want to say **HUGE THANKS** to those who joined us. Development is in overdrive to make sure we can soon release a public version for all of you to patch with. If you can't wait, you can still join the program!

Also, lots of work goes into preparing for the [upcoming NODE20](http://20.nodeforum.org/). A growing team of now about 50 people is working behind the scenes trying to make this special version of NODE worthwhile even though we can not mingle in person. Workshop-wise we're still not complete. Here is where you get the best overview of what's coming your way:

**[NODE20 workshops](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/workshops/)**

In other news: If you're interested in machine learning, you may want to test this new pack we just released: [VL.RunwayML](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-runwayml/18770) allows you to run any model provided by <runwayml.com> directly as a node in vvvv!
