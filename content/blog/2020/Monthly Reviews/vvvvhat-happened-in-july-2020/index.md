Boooom!

Right in the sommerloch we finally have an **[earlyaccess release of VL.Stride](/blog/2020/vl.stride-earlyaccess-available-now)**. For now, this is limited to owners of a vvvv gamma license. So if you always thought about supporting the development of vvvv, now is a good moment. [Insert coin](http://store.vvvv.org), get a vvvv gamma license at 20% discount and get access to the VL.Stride preview right now!

Further:
* [vvvv gamma 2020.1.7](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2020.1.7-release) bugfix release is out!
* The promised [wrap-up of support for depth cameras](/blog/2020/revvvvamped-support-for-depth-cameras) is available. All repatched from scratch with full source code access for you.
* There is a first preview nuget out for the much-simplified handling of OSC in vvvv: Try [VL.IO.OSC](https://www.nuget.org/packages/vl.io.osc).

## Coming up: NODE20
Wtih many things now falling into place for vvvv gamma, we're really happy to have [NODE20 - Second Nature](/blog/2020/node20-second-nature) coming up soon (October 2nd-8th). This will be a full week of interesting discussions, sharing knowledge and learning about the future of visualprogramming (as we like to call it). Hope to see all of you there! If you haven't already, watch the recording of the [5th worldwide vvvv meetup](/blog/2020/5.-worldwide-vvvv-meetup) where you get a preview of what's going to happen during NODE20...
