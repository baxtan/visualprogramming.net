Bonjour from paris,

where I was happy to witness a short AV performance by {{< user "dottore" >}} which he developed as part of a [residency](https://vertigo.starts.eu/calls/starts-residencies-call-3/residencies/still/detail/) with us. vvvv gamma + VL.Xenko used to its finest...

Right after we had a nice vvvv meetup in a local bar and talked Xenko and timelines till late. Up next are [workshops on Tuesday and Thursday](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-workshops-in-paris) and a [presentation at Ircam](/blog/vvvv-at-ircam-forum-parisp) on Friday.

Meanwhile back on vvvv.org we opened a [new store](/blog/2020/moving-forward-store-2.0) and our [call for creative coder in residency](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/creativvvve-coder-in-residence-2020/18283/) is still going till March 8!

With vvvv gamma we're getting closer to a release-candidate phase. We still have a few known issues we want to sort out before, but no more show stoppers. Please follow our progress and [fetch latest previews from here](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2019.2-preview).
