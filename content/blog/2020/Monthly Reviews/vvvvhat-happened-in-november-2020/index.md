November!

A seemingly calm month, but it is boiling under the covvvvers: First, you notice that we continue to update the 2020.2 release with bugfixes. The latest release is [vvvv gamma 2020.2.4](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2020.2.html).

Then, as mentioned previously, we're currently mostly focused on getting a stable 2020.3 out which will include VL.Stride, our shiny new 3d engine. Best of it: you can follow our daily progress by downloading the [preview releases](http://visualprogramming.net/#download). Already comes with tons of help and demo patches. Give it a spin!

If you haven't yet, watch the [recording of the last vvvv meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzqaoN7QCSg) where, among others, we have {{< user "texone" >}} show us how he already takes VL.Stride to the next level...


And finally done are the completely reworked, easy to use OSC and TUIO nodes which will show up in one of the coming previews soon!
