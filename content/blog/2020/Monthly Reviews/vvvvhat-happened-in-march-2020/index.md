It happened!

As if it was yesterday when we first announced our plans for what is now vvvv gamma. It has finally landed. Please read all about it in the still hot [vvvv gamma 2020.1 release announcement](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2020.1-release).

So now is really the time to jump onto it and for this, besides the growing number of [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkCvVja4YlY&list=PLBTgwgsWWcT_VMMrwsy3Ao7_ubazEGL4s), in April, we offer this **[series of webinars](/blog/introduction-webinars-to-vvvv-(gamma))**. 

Despite corona, meetups are still happening, but online! This means that now everybody can join us and present what they're working on. Get inspired by the [recording of the first edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwu9PWRXsW4) and if you have something to show or discuss, please head over to the [#2 vvorldvvide Meetup](/blog/2-vvorldvvide-meetup) and let us know.
