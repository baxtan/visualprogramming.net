It happened so,

that we have just released [vvvv gamma 2020.1.4](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2020.1.4-release) and [vvvv beta40](/blog/2020/vvvv50beta40) which includes latest VL. So beta and gamma are now finally using the same version of VL again. Is this still confusing anyone? 

We still owe you the promised round-up of developments regarding depth cameras but meanwhile already started work on some networking libs. Please check our work in progress on [VL.IO.TCP](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-io-tcp), [VL.IO.WebSocket](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-io-websocket/) and [VL.IO.HTTP.WebServer](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-io-http-webserver). And there is also a library to use tablets now: [VL.Devices.WinTab](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-devices-wintab).

Have you ever wondered how a visual language is being designed? We invite you to [join our discussions](/blog/2020/vl-language-design-repository) and help us design the future of visual programming.

Too bad we didn't yet manage to show some of our progress on VL.Stride. It is coming along nicely. Hoping to have some demos out this month.

If you missed it, please checkout the [recording of the 4th worldwide meetup](https://youtu.be/i0zd68tDUVE) where {{< user "david" >}} talks about progress on the upcoming NODE20, {{< user "mburk" >}} and {{< user "a_a_a_a" >}} give us a preview of the NODE20 keyvisual they are working on, {{< user "nisidis" >}} talks about his work in progress of integrating VL with Blender, called VL.Ender and where {{< user "dottore" >}} demonstrated his latest developments on his UI widget library {{< contribution "vl.elementa" "VL.Elementa" >}}.
