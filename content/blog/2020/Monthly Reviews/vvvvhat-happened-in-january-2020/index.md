Meanwhile,

work continues as per the usual on our quest to release a smooth vvvv gamma 2020.1 within Q1. [Previews](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2019.2-preview) are coming out about once a week now. Most recently we introduced another improvement for [help patches](/blog/2020/vl-help-patches). 

We have a [progress report on VL.Xenko](/blog/2020/vl-xenko-3d-engine-update-3) out and in parallel, we're also working on a [ContributionManager for vvvv beta](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/contributionmanager-for-vvvv-beta/18226), which is ready for a test-drive now.

Into numerology? You may be interested in [last year's numbers and figures](/blog/2020/vvvv-in-numbers-2019).

And if you're up for meeting your fellow patchers in real-life, make sure not to miss our upcoming [intro workshops, meetups and patching circles](/blog/2020/upcoming-intro-workshops-meetups-and-patching-circles) in Berlin. Here is the [stream of our most recent meetup](https://youtu.be/zwLVcvGfPic) where we heard news from ur-patcher {{< user "sunep" >}}.
