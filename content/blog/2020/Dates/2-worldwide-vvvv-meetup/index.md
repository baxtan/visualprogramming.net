{{< user "eps" >}}

Vadim used vvvv+shaders as a weapon-of-choice for ~10 years, doing high profile VJing/videomapping/installations for living (teaming with {{< user "antokhio" >}}, {{< user "idwyr" >}}, {{< user "vux" >}}, etc. for studio projects. A few years ago he switched to the neural networks, using vvvv now mostly for integration and/or simple extra tasks. Vadim will show few examples of such usage (spout/osc integration, image pre/post-processing), as well as some key findings and achievements in general
