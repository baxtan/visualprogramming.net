Hey vvvvolks,

it's Meetup Tuesday again: **July 28th 8pm CET** we will have our 5th online meetup for vvvv users around the globe and it wonâ€™t be the last for sure. Prepare your family and cool the wine. Members of the community will entertain you with fresh projects and shiny patches.

{{< youtube "EiHW0X6zjKE" >}}


##  Want to join with your presentation?
We could have one or two more demos/presentations! Anything more or less related to vvvv, yourself and your projects. Share some thoughts, share your funny fails. Share what you are up to. 

Please get in touch via meetup@vvvv.org and let us know what you want to present. We'll then get back to you and organize the streaming tool etc. We are looking forward to this! {{< user "a_a_a_a" >}} {{< user "david" >}} {{< user "joreg" >}}  {{< user "sebl" >}} 

Here is the plan: We'll be using again a video-conferencing platform for moderators and presenters and will be streaming out to evvvveryone via youtube and possibly other channels as well. Updates on how to use the back channel will be given. Live stream link will be provided here!

###  NODE20 Q&A
Location: Frankfurt
{{< user "david" >}} {{< user "katzenfresser" >}}

[](https://20.nodeforum.org/)

This is not a project presentation, but David and Johannes will introduce you to this years NODE edition. 
There's too much to say about it... in short it's about what and how will happen when and what is so special about it.

In the second part, it's up to you to ask questions about NODE - this time we try to integrate participants into the video stream for fun!
