Paris mon amour!

Je m'appel {{< user "joreg" "schoreg" >}} and I will come visit and wanted to ask if you'd be up for a date. The wonderful {{< user "sebescudie" >}} is currently looking for a space but we already have a time and date: **March 1st, 8pm**

So please save the date and prepare your patches. It would be great to have some of you show what you're working on. We'll have {{< user "dottore" >}} giving insights into his latest works and I'll be having latest [VL.Xenko](/blog/2020/vl-xenko-3d-engine-update-3) with me for a sneak peak.

If you feel like, please RSVP on the [GetTogether announcement](https://gettogether.community/events/4370/vvvv-paris-meetup-1/).
