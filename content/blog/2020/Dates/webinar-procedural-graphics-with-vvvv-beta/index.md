vvvv is well known for its realtime graphics powers. If you want to understand the proper workflow on how to achieve procedural realtime visuals you have to understand the packs and contributions and their most important nodes. This webinar takes you there.

We will be learning how to create a procedural graphic using vvvv beta. In combination with {{< contribution "FieldTrip" >}} and some other interesting packs and nodes such as spline buffer Matcap and so on, we will develop an artistic good looking visual in a dense quality and color which can be used as a poster, wall paper or whatever.

This course is a good basis to dive deeper into the scene at this years online edition of [NODE20 â€“ Forum for Digital Arts](http://20.nodeforum.org). Prepare your neurons and get ready.
