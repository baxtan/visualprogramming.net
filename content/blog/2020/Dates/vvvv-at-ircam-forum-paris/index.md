Looking forward to presenting vvvv at this years [Ircam Forum](https://forum.ircam.fr/collections/detail/les-ateliers-du-forum-paris-2020/). With Ircam being the birthplace of both [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max) and [PD](http://puredata.info/), which quite inspired vvvv initially, it will be a great honor to hopefully give some inspiration back.

Here is what it is generally about:

Whether you are a musician, sound engineer, designer; Whether you work in research and development on new technologies; Whether you are a teacher or student, professional or just an aficionado, you are welcome to join us at this annual meeting at IRCAM, Paris. {{< /box >}}

[My talk](https://forum.ircam.fr/article/detail/joreg/) is on Friday, March 6th, 11h45 - 12h15 and and here is the full list of [this years speakers](https://forum.ircam.fr/collections/detail/intervenants-et-presentations/).

Hope to see some of you there!
