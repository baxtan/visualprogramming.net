# Wednesday
<!--{SPLIT()}-->
## Introduction to Computer Vision
In this workshop, we will start with a general overview of the functionality provided by VL.OpenCV to then dive in a hands-on session where we will experiment with some of the more accessible and exciting features that this library ships with.
[Full Info](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=IcbxamJNFpQkPr7qFAoM)

## Patching Materials
Materials define the appearance of 3D model surfaces and how they react to light. They can affect both the geometry of a model and its colors and multiple material layers can be combined to build more complex materials. In this workshop, we're going to explore the node-set that allows us to patch custom materials.

## The Stride Game Studio
Stride is an open-source C# game engine for realistic rendering and VR. But how to get started? In this workshop we'll go through the basics of getting Stride, managing projects, importing assets and creating and controlling entities in a scene.

## Object Oriented Patching
Visualprogramming is often equivalent to dataflow programming. With VL though, you can also use metaphors known from object-oriented programming. This means that with VL you can define your own datatypes, instantiate them, manage them in collections and call individual operations on instances. 
[Full Info](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=1IG2LfEXpeMs7KU6pGYp)

## A preview to ShaderFX
Visual shader patching? Yes, please! These days, all major game engines have node-based material and/or visual effects editors. And their common purpose is to provide a way to work creatively with CPU and GPU data. The experimental ShaderFX in VL.Stride generalizes this approach and takes it one step further. You work with CPU & GPU data and operations on the same canvas, at runtime – vvvv style.

## The State of Machine Learning
This talk looks back over a few years of swimming against the tide of Python to make machine learning a technology easy to use with vvvv. You'll see that, by getting your head around a few important principles, running models in vvvv can be pretty straight forward.
[Full Info](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=pkcWLlOKsY70VHcPpHfH)
## VL.Stride Deepdive
One major strength of VL.Stride is that it offers an easy to use scene graph and at the same time lets you go as far down to the graphics API as you want. This workshop will approach 3d rendering from these two opposite ends and you'll learn how to combine them.
