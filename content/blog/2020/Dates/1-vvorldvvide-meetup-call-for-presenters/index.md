Helo vvvvorld,

so this is how you wanted it to happen all along: The next vvvv meetup on March 24th will be vvorldvvide and online only!

Here is the plan: We'll be using a video-conferencing platform for moderators and presenters and will be streaming out to evvvveryone via [our TV channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu-xqv-TLwv6L0An7MJJA5A) with [our chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#vvvv:matrix.org) as your backchannel. And we're looking for up to 4 presenters to show us what they are working on. Anything vvvv counts, 15min max. How does that sound?

Now it is up to you: Please get in touch via meetup@vvvv.org and let us know what you want to present. We'll then get back to you and organize for the streaming. 

Hope to get some more international vvvvolks in this way... 
Looking forward to this!
