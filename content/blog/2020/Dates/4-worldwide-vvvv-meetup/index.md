Hey vvvvolks,

it's Meetup Tuesday again: **June 23th 8pm CET** we will meet again in the interwebz!

#  Want to join with your presentation?
We could have one or two more demos/presentations! Anything more or less related to vvvv, yourself and your projects. Share some thoughts, share your funny fails. Share what you are up to. 

Please get in touch via meetup@vvvv.org and let us know what you want to present. We'll then get back to you and organize the streaming tool etc. We are looking forward to this! {{< user "a_a_a_a" >}} {{< user "david" >}} {{< user "joreg" >}}  {{< user "sebl" >}} 

Here is the plan: We'll be using again a video-conferencing platform for moderators and presenters and will be streaming out to evvvveryone via youtube and possibly other channels as well. Updates on how to use the back channel will be given. Live stream link will be provided here!
