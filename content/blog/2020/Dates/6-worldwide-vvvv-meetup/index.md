## Want to share your work?
We could have one or two more demos/presentations! Anything more or less related to vvvv, yourself and your projects. Share some thoughts, share your funny fails. Or just ask some questions...

Please get in touch via **meetup@vvvv.org** and let us know what you want to talk about. We'll then get back to you and organize the streaming tool etc.

Here is our line-up so far:

## wirmachenbunt
[wirmachenbunt](https://vvvv.org/businesses/wirmachenbunt): Joscha Brüning, Thomas Gross, Nils Nahrwold, Christian Engler 
Location: Hamburg 

[](http://wirmachenbunt.de) 

wirmachenbunt is a studio for interactive and immersive shows and exhibits. The team will present the Magenta Moon Garden software, the system behind a 360° interactive space, incorporating 16 projectors, 9 Radartouch sensors, 6 channel surround sound, 4 games and lots of pixels. While the visual output is rendered with vvvv beta, they used VL and vvvv gamma heavily for the backend and surround sound engine, marking a transition of the studio workflow. While going into the patch details, they reveal the process, from simulation to the live setup.
