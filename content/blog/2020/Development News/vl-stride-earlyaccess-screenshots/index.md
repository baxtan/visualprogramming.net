Did you ever wonder what the first things were, that the cool kids in the [VL.Stride EarlyAccess program](/blog/2020/vl.stride-earlyaccess-available-now) created with the new 3d rendering engine for vvvv gamma?

It's been only a few weeks, but stunning pixel combinations got posted into our early access chat room.

And we collected them in a gallery for you:

A big THANK YOU to everyone involved!

We can't wait to see what you will create with it. And don't miss [the workshops at NODE20](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/workshops/) if you want to learn how to use it.

We are looking forward to the public release as much as you do,
yours devvvvs
