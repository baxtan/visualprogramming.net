Thanks a lot for implementing those cameras!!!
For my course of studies I am currently exploring the use of depthcameras in a creative sense. I also got access to a zed. I found that the zed has far more reach then orbec ( like up to 20m!!!) which would be a great plus in terms of beeing able to cover greater distances. Is there a possibility that the zed can be implemented in here too?
