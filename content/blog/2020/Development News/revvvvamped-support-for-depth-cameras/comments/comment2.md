Hi! With this one you can do the basics only - retrieve an image and/or depth in any provided format. It returns OpenCV image.
Unfortunately I haven't test with latest gamma versions. You can give it a try - if something is not working, please open an issue.
I'm also planning to update it to Stride and latest SDK with full functionality since we are getting a ZED 2, but it will take some time.
