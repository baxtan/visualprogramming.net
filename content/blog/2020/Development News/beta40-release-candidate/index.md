Evvvveryone,

is happy, that we're finally looking at a candidate for beta40, which will ship with the latest and may i say greatest integration of VL to date that is 2020.1.4!

For the latest changes in VL, please consult the [vvvv gamma series 2020.1.X changelog](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2020.1.html).

Most notably this gives you access to all the latest goodies that are popping up as .NET nugets lately. Yes, we're still missing a convenient overview of those, but meanwhile a [search for VL on .nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=vl) gives you an idea. Still wondering how to use those? Watch this tutorial on [How to use Nugets](https://youtu.be/-U_kUQ3VDog) to find out.

So please test this against your current projects. Make sure that everything is running as expected. If not, please leave a comment below or let us know in [the forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/vvvv-beta).
