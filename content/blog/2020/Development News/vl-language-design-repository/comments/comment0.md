Very nice idea! I think this will really streamline the interaction between devs and users.

Maybe one wish:
I totally get, that you don't wan't to confuse IDE features with language features. But my personal concern is acutall mostly with the IDE and UI / UX of vvvv gamma at this point, as this has by far the biggest impact on how I actually use the language.
So maybe setting up something similar for everything IDE / UI would be a possibillity?
