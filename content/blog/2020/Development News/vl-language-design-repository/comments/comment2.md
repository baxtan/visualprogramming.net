@mburk, we've obviously anticipated this request and will reconsider it at some point. but let's give us some time to start such a new process slowly and see how it works and feels with one topic first. for language it feels the right time to start this process now. for other topics, we just don't feel to be in the right position yet. 

that said, please keep your IDE/UX requests coming in the feature-request forum. even if they are not immediately answered they are not lost there. we'll get back to them, when we're on them.
