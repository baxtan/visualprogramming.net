Hello everyone!

We are pleased to announce that from now on [VL language design ideas will be specified in public](https://github.com/vvvv/VL-Language). 
This allows you to see
* which areas we identified to work on (quests)
* what ideas we came up with to fix those issues (proposals)
* which proposals got favored over other proposals (decisions)
* which proposals got moved onto which milestone

But it also allows you to join forces with us. Since in the end, it's all about your patches, we appreciate your feedback. 

We decided to start clean: For now, we didn't throw all our language ideas into this repository. In its current state, we only see issues that came up in the last days, so the selection of issues is quite incomplete. Other ideas that might be more important and didn't come up in these days will eventually make it there as soon as they come up again.

We'll address quests by you or us with proposals that might be fresh or have been around for some time. We'll try to communicate different approaches and the pros and cons. And we'll try to single out very few issues that are just too promising to not having a shot at. Changing the language is quite hard, so expect an insane ratio of proposalsThatSoundNice / featuresComingSoon.

We were quite impressed by how this was handled by the [C# Language Design Team](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang). So we copied the approach.

Sometimes it's hard to distinguish between the language and ways of expression within the language. You just search for a way to address a certain problem. How would I structure my patches? We'll allow these so-called design patterns to be discussed in this repository as we want the language to be able to follow well-established ideas on how to solve certain types of problems. [Here is an example](https://github.com/vvvv/VL-Language/issues/10).

But for now: Welcome to the club! \o/
