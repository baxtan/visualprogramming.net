This is my talk at Ircam [earlier this year](https://forum.ircam.fr/collections/detail/les-ateliers-du-forum-paris-2020/), where I tried to introduce vvvv gamma to an audience not necessarily familiar with vvvv but most likely already with the idea of visual programming. Given the fact that Ircam was the [birthplace of Max and PD](https://puredata.info/docs/faq/pdmaxjmax) which are still both in heavy use there. 

In 25 minutes I tried to give a glimpse at vvvv by focusing on four things that I believe make it shine:
- Loops
- Multithreading
- Object Oriented Patching
- Extensibility

Also I pretended that it is completely normal to already have a 3d engine with it...
