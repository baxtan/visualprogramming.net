Probably,

the biggest NODE so far, in terms of reach. At least if you want to believe the viewing numbers on the [videos of the daily streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi8N-UjBVL0d0zNdIxs_QuXnr16QhUqd2). This time the whole world was able to participate and not only a handful of privileged being able to come to Frankfurt. What an undertaking to run a pop-up TV station for 7 days next to a 2 track, 9h a day workshop program...

On behalf of the whole team that made this edition possible, vvvv wants to thank {{< user "david" >}} and Jeanne Charlotte Vogt, directors of [NODE20 - Second Nature](http://20.nodeforum.org/), for pulling the strings. Once again very well done, chapeau!

The team was huge and a lot of different things happened over the course of this week, too numerous to recap here. So in this blogpost I want to particularly summarize the vvvv focused parts and highlight the members of the vvvv community who helped make NODE20 possible.

## TV Shows
You should watch them all: [7 days of quality panels and discussions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi8N-UjBVL0d0zNdIxs_QuXnr16QhUqd2) around this years topic "Second Nature". But then, as promised, the following is a listing of the more vvvv related shows for your viewing pleasure:

* [The Emergency Broadcast Studio](https://youtu.be/SqtvLRB_dQk?t=9304) - Behind the Scenes, where {{< user "readme" >}} talks about how he and {{< user "bjoern" >}} took on the brave task of running the AR studio on VL.Stride, which was still very much in the works when they started...Must watch to get an impression of the effort of what was behind the studio setup. Credits also go to {{< user "kopffarben" >}} who helped running the actual shows in the end!
