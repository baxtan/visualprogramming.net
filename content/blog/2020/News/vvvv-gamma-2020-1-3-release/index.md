Because we care,

![](vvvv-2020.1.3.png)

here is the third bug-fix release for vvvv gamma! Available for **[download](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download)** and **[purchase](https://store.vvvv.org)**. Now!

I don't think this one has a highlight other than fixing a few nasty buggers. So be sure to update, there shouldn't be a reason not to. If you disagree, please let us know in the comments here or in the [vvvv gamma forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/vvvv-gamma/28).

For the full list of changes, see the[Log of Changes](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2020.1.html).

Happy patching!
