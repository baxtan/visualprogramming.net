## Building a game from scratch
Host: {{< user "joreg" >}}

Once you're familiar with the basics of a programming language you need a little challenge. Building a game from scratch is usually a good way of diving deeper. Games have all the aspects of proper applications. They require you to handle user input, manage the game logic, maybe keep a high-score or save a state to disk so it can be recalled the next day. 

So in this webinar we're going to build a simple game and along the way get familiar with how to structure the different components of applications.

##  Visual programming for Coders
Host: {{< user "elias" >}}

You are familiar with words like class, method, interface and generics? You are curious how visual live-programming with vvvv gamma can speed up your development process? Great, then this workshop is for you!

vvvv is a visual live programming environment that allows you to build and change .NET applications in real-time while they are running, thanks to incremental compilation and state hot-reload. Oh, and we are serious about this – everything is statically typed.
