In these corona times, it is comforting to know that there are vvvv users out there who have years of experience and are available to help you get things done. Not only [for free](https://discourse.vvvv.org/), but also as professionally paid specialists. So we created this long-overdue list:

{{< box >}}
**[vvvv Specialists Available for Hire!](https://legacy.vvvv.org/documentation/vvvv-specialists-available-for-hire)**

{{< /box >}}

The list is manually maintained by the individuals on it. It gives you an overview of who is available right now. Services include:
- Freelance work
- Consulting
- Production and project management
- Personal tutoring
- Group workshops
- Collaborative artworks

## Are you a vvvv specialist yourself?

Then please add yourself to the page whenever you're available for hire. Also please remove yourself in times you're occupied so that it is easier for those looking for someone to find relevant entries.
