##  vvvvolks. What a node! 
Me and the complete team recover slowly. NODE was a blast and we can be incredibly proud to made it happen under the 2020 conditions. I do believe that the hybrid approach is something that has some future potential. Heads are spinning already how a next node would need to be.
To get some structured feedback we have setup this survey for all participants:

You can help to make NODE better by filling this out. Thank you so much!

##  The recordings
Many have asked us for the workshop recordings. And here are some good news:

*For those who attended NODE20: please go ahead and login to [NODE20 on Talque](https://www.talque.com/app#/app/org/org-event/jTiDQhBciSV8rDuqoYvi/vh1T77z52634S1Xq43g5/info) to review the workshops there. 

*For those who did not attend but want to learn the same: We have bundled all the recordings into one course at the NODE Institute, which you can buy for 50 Euros only. 30 workshops, 90 hours of learning. Its massive!

Here is the story behind the decision: When we announced the festival in July/August it was clear that we have to give the ticket owners some exclusive access to the recordings afterwards to actually make them onboard the festival. Otherwise -  we assumed -  many could have chosen to simply wait until the festival is over and wait for the public recording. The festival would not have worked at all.

Now after the festival it feels a bit unnatural to hide the recordings to curious new people. Why not ride the wave of attention we created? Selling the recordings became an option. It would also help to close a financial gap of the overall festival budget. After some talks with the hosts about how we can handle this in a fair way we came to the conclusion that we will split the income between the Instructors and the festival. This feels natural as the institutes idea is to help the community to sustain and help instructors to get revenue for their educational work. The income does not got to the vvvv group but to all community instructors.

Love goes to all of the instructors and organizers and contributors. We are all deeply thankful for their effort and contribution. {{< user "ravel" >}}, {{< user "sebescudie" >}}, {{< user "Rayment" >}}, {{< user "katzenfresser" >}} and Ben Schiek, {{< user "andresc4" >}}, Anna Meik, {{< user "antokhio" >}}, {{< user "baxtan" >}}, {{< user "domj" >}}, {{< user "dottore" >}}, {{< user "elias" >}}, {{< user "everyoneishappy" >}}, {{< user "gregsn" >}}, Gene Kogan, {{< user "hayden" >}}, {{< user "idwyr" >}}, {{< user "joreg" >}}, {{< user "jule" >}}, {{< user "kleinkariert" >}}, {{< user "lasal" >}}, Maria Heine, Marian Dziubiak, {{< user "motzi" >}}, {{< user "ravazquez" >}}, {{< user "sebl" >}}, {{< user "sunep" >}}, {{< user "Takuma" >}}, {{< user "tonfilm" >}}, {{< user "untone" >}}, {{< user "vux" >}}, {{< user "readme" >}}, {{< user "bjoern" >}},{{< user "kopffarben" >}} and more vvvv people in the program.
