## vvvv in education
You may say we're biased, but we believe that vvvv is one of the more suitable ways to get people in touch with topics like creative coding, generative design, computer graphics, interaction design, data visualization, computer vision, physical computing, machine learning and similar. This is even more true for the [all-new vvvv gamma](http://visualprogramming.net). Why? Here is a list of pros and cons with a focus on use in education: 

## Pros
- It is free for non-commercial/educational use without any restrictions or registration
- It is quick and easy to install
- Its visual live-programming approach allows you to get to results and iterate quickly
- It comes with a HelpBrowser that makes it easy to find tutorials and documentation on various topics
- It is easily extendable with custom nodes by writing standard C# code or using almost any .NET nuget
- All of its libraries are open-source, meaning they can be explored, learned from and extended
- It uses industrie standard programming concepts known from object-oriented programming that once understood, can also be applied in other programming languages
- The core developers and fine community of users offer direct help support via chat and the forum basically 24/7/365

## Cons (status fall 2020)
- It runs on Windows only
- It cannot export to mobile, the web or microcontrollers

Hope to see you at NODE!
