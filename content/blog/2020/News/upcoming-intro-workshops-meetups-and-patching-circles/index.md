Helo evvvveryone,

We're starting into 2020 with a couple of activities, culminating in the [recently announced NODE2020](/blog/2019/node-2020) happening in October. So leading up to that, here is what we got for you in the first quarter of this year:

## Intro vvvv gamma workshops
**Every fourth Tuesday a month** we're running a vvvv gamma intro workshop for total beginners. It goes for 2 hours and gives participants an idea of how it feels to work with vvvv gamma. Here you learn the fundamentals that you need to be able to follow further workshops or take the next steps on your own, continuing with online learning resources. Spread the word, send your friends and family!

Available dates:
* January 28, 6-8pm
* February 25, 6-8pm
* March 24, 6-8pm
* April 28, 6-8pm

The workshop costs 5â‚¬ and you can **[sign up here](https://nodeforum.org/announcements/2020-series-of-2h-introduction-workshops-to-vvvv-gamma/)**.

## Meetups
Right after every intro workshop, meaning **also every fourth Tuesday a month**, starting 8pm, we're running a vvvv meetup. Here we count on you: Have a project, demo or new library to show? Just come with your laptop and present. Low profile, no pressure. Doesn't need to be polished, rough around the edges is very welcome! Or just grab a drink and lean back...

## Patching Circles
The patching circle is a vvvv support group. Once a month, **every second thursday**, we're meeting to help each other out and find collaborators for our projects. So please join us for patching and drinks if you...
* are stuck in your patches and could use some advice
* want to help others with your experience
* just want to click yourself away in a patch-friendly atmosphere

If you feel like coming to a meetup or patching circle, please announce your participation in our [getogether events](https://gettogether.community/vvvv/).

All the above are happening at the cozy NODE Institute, Wipperstrase 13 in 12055 Berlin/Germany. If you're running a similar event, be sure to also post an announcement here in the blog to get the attention of your local vvvvriends.
