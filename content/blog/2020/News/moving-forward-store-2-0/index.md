Helo shopaholics!

This is to announce vvvv's new [License Store](https://store.vvvv.org).

When logged in with your vvvv.org credentials you can see an [overview of all your orders](https://store.vvvv.org/orders), which should look something like this:

![](myorders.png) 

Please compare this listing to your [previous order listing](https://store.vvvv.org/). In case you're missing an order in this view, let us know via licensing@vvvv.org. We've tried our best to import old orders but there is a chance that some may not be correctly assigned to your account yet.

This is also a great moment to check your current licensing situation: Please make sure all your commercial use is covered. If not, we're looking forward to your new orders. Try it, it is now more fun than ever to buy vvvv licenses! And also check the price-drop on the dongles: From 125€ to 80€ per piece. What a bargain!

## Next Steps
We know everyone is waiting to finally be able to buy vvvv gamma licenses. Just in time with the upcoming first official 2020.1 release, we'll have those in stock. These will initially come without the promised [subscription options](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-licensing-2), but the plan is to have those added just in time so that any order can be converted to a subscription before its first update.

Then, obviously this new store was also built with the idea in mind that it can one day sell [user contributions](https://store.vvvv.org/). We cannot promise anything at this point, but at least we have the technical infrastructure in place now...

Happy shopping!
