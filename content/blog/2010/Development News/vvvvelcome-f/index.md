yes, yes we know, all you ever wanted was to write vvvv plugins with a functional programming language. and since microsoft officially added F# to the main .NET languages you can do that right away. thanks to [Don Syme](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/dsyme/), who is the leading developer of F#.
<!--break-->
we uploaded [some code templates](http://vvvv.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/vvvv/plugins/f%23/) to start from and one more advanced example which fits very well in the functional programming style:

- Basic Value Template
- DirectX Layer Template
- DirectX Texture Template
- Iterative Function System

althogh we uploaded all code with #develop solutions, we highly recommend to use visual studio 2010 professional because of its F# IntelliSense. you can still [download the release candidate for free](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=f9c0b89b-4964-4906-94c6-60ad8a429690&displaylang=en), but hurry up, the official release is at 12th april.

if you have questions, ask them in our [vvvvorums](http://vvvv.org/tiki-view_forum.php?forumId=22).
