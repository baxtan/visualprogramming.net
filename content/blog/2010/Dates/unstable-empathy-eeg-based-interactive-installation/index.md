![Ustable Empathy](area1_double.jpg) 

**Unstable Empathy** is a project by Mattia Casalegno and Enzo Varriale (aka Lanvideosource), produced by iMal for the Media Facade Festival 2010 and Nuite Blanch Brussels.

**Unstable Empathy** is an intimate environment re-mediated in real-time by the mind activity of two players who are constantly forced to negotiate their emphatic state. It is a collaborative experience in which the meanings of cooperation, entangling and collective consciousness are directly perceived on the physiological level.

At each session, EEG headsets are being mounted on the heads of two participants which will be positioned in front of each other in complete darkness. Their respective brain activities are the only means by which they can reach the other and its image, while rendering visible and audible un/revealing strategies that are part of their inner self.

The installation will be on show at iMal from 1th to 3th October 2010.
