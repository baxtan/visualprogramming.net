helo vvvvolks,

i'd like to bring to your attention what i believe is a rather unique setup: [Schmiede](http://schmiede.ca) is a yearly festival where likeminded people gather in Hallein/Austria for 10 days to work together. there are also talks, presentations and workshops but the main idea is to learn by doing what you already can.
<!--break-->
at last years Schmiede Claudia Rohrmoser realized her project  [Cinema Vertigo](http://cinemavertigo.tv) which is a largescale interactive video installation based on vvvv. the 15 meters high vertical screen setup will be there again this year and Schmiede is looking for people who'd be interested to create audiovisual content for it or do something completely different.

taking place in september this will be a good warmup for node10 in november. [application](http://schmiede.ca/application) is open until may 31st, hope to see some of you there.
