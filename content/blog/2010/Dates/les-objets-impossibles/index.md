Dear vvvvriends,

on the 27th of november we will perform in Paris at the Cité de la Musique.
It's a new project we've been working on lately, we will take care of the realtime projected images while the Ensemble Intercontemporain will perform two pieces from the russian composer Dmitri Kourliandski.
Each musician of the Ensemble will be analyzed separately in Max-MSP, thanks to Thomas Goepfer from IRCAM, and the resulting data are sent to vvvv which generates the visuals. We will interact in realtime, controlling several parameters of the piece, as well as directing the camera movements.

Here some images and links, there are more images on our flickr.
Obviusly we'd love to see some vvvvolks there, let us know if you're coming!
