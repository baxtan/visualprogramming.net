Note:
NODE - Forum for Digital Arts.

November 15th - 20th, 2010: NODE10 – Forum For Digital Arts
In cooperaton with the Frankfurter Kunstverein and the vvvv group
http://node.vvvv.org  
{{< /box >}}


The purpose of NODE is to facilitate the exchange between art, design and engineering in interactive and generative media. The 'NODE - Forum for Digital Arts' emerged in 2008 from an initiative of associates of MESO who at the same time had been developers and users of the graphical programming language vvvv (http://vvvv.org).

At first, NODE was meant to support the community of people using vvvv to create artistic and creative software projects, but it quickly changed into an international forum for knowledge exchange between designers, artists and engineers of various fields believing in the powers of programming and digital technologies. NODE08 turned out to be a one week-long rush of discussions, theoretical and practical lectures and workshops, artist presentations and events.

NODE10 should go way beyond NODE08. So, the focus of this year's lectures and exhibition 'abstrakt Abstrakt' is the investigation of cultural consequences of a post-industrialized, software-driven society. The workshops and open lab complement the theoretical views with practical hands on workshops about vvvv and related programming environments. Participants look into the subjects through workshops and talks combined with subsequent symposiums and live performances.

Here are some hightlights:
