CAM is accepting submissions from new media artists and designers for artwork to be included in a Technology + Art + Design exhibition at the new Contemporary Art Museum (CAM), a museum of art and design in Raleigh, NC.  CAM intends to include a broad range of artistic practices and is particularly interested in proposals of site-specific work that necessitates a physical location in order to experience it.
