ladies and boys of near and far come and see: vvvv is wearing a new wig.

first a little history:
[vvvvs initial website](http://web.archive.org/web/20021101213348/http://vvvv.meso.net/) as captured by archive.org on nov 1st 2002
[vvvvs first tikiwiki based website](http://web.archive.org/web/20050205214212/vvvv.meso.net/tiki-index.php) as captured on jan 09 2005
[vvvvs tikiwiki facelift](http://web.archive.org/web/20061118180717/vvvv.org/tiki-index.php) captured on july 09 2006

so it was finally time to move on. and here you are. lets see what we've got. first of all the 3 main sections as we know them:
- blog: news, gallery, screenshots, ...
- forum: vvvv q&a
- wiki: the documentation section
 
and now the specials:
* the [Contributions](https://vvvv.org/contributions) section: a place to share modules/effects/demos..., tag, filter and comment them. multiple revisions per item allow to improve stuff instead of having several copies of similar items floating around in the forum. for details see [About the Contributions](https://vvvv.org/documentation/using-addons#contributions).
* the [Forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/) is now reduced to one filterable by various types of tags and replies can now be marked to solve a question cleaning up long threads. for details read [About the Forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org).
* the [Documentation](https://betadocs.vvvv.org), while still a wiki is now structured hierarchically. users can place "requests for review" on individual pages that seem outdated. for details read [About the Documentation](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/).
* the [Blog](https://www.visualprogramming.net/blog/2009/) now automatically posts content added to the vimeo channel vvvv, the flickr group vvvv and links tagged "vvvv" on delicious giving us a better overview of what happens with vvvv on the web. for details read [About the Blog](https://www.visualprogramming.net/blog/2009/).

login is now possible via OpenID, search is improved and quite some more. we basically tried to realize [all of your wishes](http://legacy.vvvv.org/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?comments_parentId=28718&topics_threshold=0&topics_offset=3&topics_sort_mode=lastPost_desc&topics_find=&forumId=2). you'll be able to upload screenshots of the day again only with the upcomming release.

now please check your [personal-](https://vvvv.org/home/settings/personal) and [system-settings](https://vvvv.org/home/settings) and your [userpages](https://vvvv.org/users/list). we are aware of some problems that happened during the import of wiki-pages. if you have troubles fixing syntax yourself shout out and we'll give you a hand.  
 
thanks a lot to all alpha and beta testers and our brave new vvvvebmaster that is David Scharf of [](http://huesforalice.com)

it is now in your hands. 
yours, vvvv group.
