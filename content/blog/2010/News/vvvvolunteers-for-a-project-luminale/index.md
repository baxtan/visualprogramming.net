Dear all,
We need a vvvv programmer who would help us/work with us voluntarily in an interactive installation for Luminale 2010 in Frankfurt.

Technically, the patching would include:
-motion tracking of people on an area of 5m. x 16m. 
-controlling of the interactive Text on the LED- Modules and two moving lights according to the data on the locations of people.
-debugging/optimization of the patches
 
We have sponsors who provide us place and equipment. 
Unfortunately, there is no money, but experience, fun and fame are guaranteed. 

Those who are interested in a collaboration and want to get more information about the project can send an email to soezcelik@markgraph.de
