it is true: on a date without any religious connotation we count up to 23, which is just a prime like any other really.

we fixed again a bunch of bugs, focused on some improvements on basic nodes and layed the ground work for new wonderful plugins. there are also some advancements in the GUI.

so have fun using the best vvvversion ever!
