@gregsn: it's really much easier than in processing, if you consider a person who is just starting using processing, and has to change a color ih his patch, then he should stop, modify code and play again ... then it is not the right color and again and again stop, modify code and play BLEAH ! vvvv is much easier and powerful, all of us abandoned processing as soon as we saw the gray icon :)
