Nice, including the new PluginInterface :)

When in a code editor, I used to do Ctrl-F to find something in the code, but the now the new search-node pops up that is used for searching for nodes. How do I search for text?

Saving a plugin used to reload it, so I could see the influence of my changes. It doesn't reload in this version. Can I reload it manually?

Thanks devvvvs!
