hi devvvs,
installed and i'm discover it. i noticed that there's not the timerflop node. it's a bug? or it has changed name?
another thing, the link of the changelog in this page seems to be wrong (i receive an acces denied if i click it)

anyway, as always, you are great :D and the finder is fantastic :D
