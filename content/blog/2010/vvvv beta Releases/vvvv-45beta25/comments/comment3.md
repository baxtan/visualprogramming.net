Merry Xmas devvvvs! really sorry,had some troubles with new release,i can't creat any node within the main path window,double click,middle&right click none of them works. after closed the main patch window,error message saying that "Exception EAccessViolation in module vvvv.exe at 001FCA49. Access violation at address 005FCA49 in module 'vvvv.exe'"

here's some debug message from the TTY:
"resulting in:An exception occurred while trying to create an instance of type 'VVVV.Nodes.WindowSwitcher.WindowSwitcherNode'

Cannnot get export 'VVVV.Nodes.WindowSwither.WindowSwitcherNode(ContractName = "VVVV.PluginInterface.V1.IPluginBase")' from part 'VVVV.Nodes.WindowSwitcher.WindowSwitcherNode'

error caught in the act"TWViewPatch : Access violation at address 005FCC36 in module 'vvvv.exe' Read of address 00000000"

the beta24,23 works as usual! did i missin something?

thank you so much!
