@ft: ctrl+f on the codeditor is a known problem in b25. for now it can only be reached by pressing and keeping pressed f first and then hitting ctrl. it is stupid of course because you get and f inserted in your text. sorry for the inconveniences..

saving a plugin should still compile it showing your changes immediately. but note that the ctrl+s is also very sensitive. code only is really saved if the * is gone in the windows title. hope that helps.
