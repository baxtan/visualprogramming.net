..what we got here.. oh xmess. sou lets see:
nothing really new to those who saw the keynode. an overview:

mainly there are 2 new windows:
**ctrl+j** opens the Project Explorer which gives you an overview of all textural code (ie. effects and dynamic nodes) in use. you can now add references to projects directly and you can specify to compile dynamic nodes as *release* or *debug* builds where *debug* is useful if you want to connect to the vvvv process with an external debugger..

**ctrl+f** opens the Finder which gives you an overview of all nodes and lets you search for nodes by tags. Check the [Finder](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/the-user-interface/finder.html) page for details.

and there is the completely overhauled handling of references to addons and the new more important role of the root patch. we prepared two pages for your reading pleasure covering those topics: [Root](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/patching/root.html) and [Nodes and Paths](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/patching/using-addons.html). in short you can now organize your own and downloaded addons more transparently anywhere on disk as long as you specify a searchpath in the root via the new {{< node "NodeList (VVVV)" >}}.

the rest is bugs and fixes. a lot of time went into performance tuning and garbage collection concerning dynamic nodes. meanwhile that should be quite usable... please check the changlog as usual. 

and now for the fish. i always wonder if salmon is aware of tasting that delicious...

yours devvvs.
we value tradition.
