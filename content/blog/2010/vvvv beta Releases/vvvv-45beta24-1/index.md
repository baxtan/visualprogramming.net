![](_NODE10-DirectX Renderer_0.png) 

bug.
fix.
release. 

no new features this time. we just tried to get rid of the most annoying bogus we introduced with beta24 making it the most rocksolid vvvversion ever (so far). most notably the CodeEditor is now also working for effects. for details see the changelog.

as of this writing: 3527068 seconds until node10.
now for some mojitos,
yours devvvvs.
