yaaah, definitely great new version.
but still things to complain:

*no update of documentation at all
*no update of basic help patch
Users have to be online and even have to search the informations about the new features (shortcuts...) like breadcrumps on several places in the blog and in the vvvvorums. If you don't have steady access to the WWW this is quite annoying.

a little one:
*changelog link above --> access denied
