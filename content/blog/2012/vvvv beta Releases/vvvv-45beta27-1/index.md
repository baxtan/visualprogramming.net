helos,

if you were happy with beta27 you should be even more happy with this release. we tried to only get rid of still annoying buggers. there should now be no reason left for anyone to still use an older version. 

so there is not much new stuff, true. but our feature-branches of development are only waiting to be merged into the alpha-line of code where you'll soon be able to testdrive new stuff.

also don't forget the addonpack this time, which for the first time includes Kinect nodes for both OpenNI and Microsoft drivers (for you to choose) and vuxens complete christmaspack among all the other goodies. 

and in the meantime, while waiting for beta28 document some of your projects in the [gallery](https://visualprogramming.net/#Showcase) and [buy more licenses](https://store.vvvv.org/).

yours,
devvvvs.
