good day patcher peoples,

here comes the most conservative bug-fix only release we ever managed to build. if you think beta27.1 was naice and stable this one should be even more to your liking. if you hated vvvv before you shouldn't hate it much more though, since not much has changed really (hopefully) except fixes. 

so definitely a winwin-release this time. and we're not resting a bit but continue to build features towards beta28 which is already taking form in the [daily builds](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews).

so please everyone upgrade now and make bugs history!
oh and while you're at it, this could be a great opportunity to [buy some fresh licenses](https://store.vvvv.org/).

and don't forget to down the [suitable addonpack](/blog/2012/addons45beta27.201)!

yours,
devvvvs.
