Yes, I see it's not clear enough; later I should scold Jeeves.

So, e.g., we have already a translate node, we added a scale and want to align it horizontally. So we select both, and scale, since it's the latest node, moves to align to translate node.
We also know that if we move a bit the translate node, would be this node to change its position in relation to scale.

In this win7 64 machine, these behaviors were put away, so that nodes moved unpredictably, e.g., only translate node would move, with no chance to make instead scale to adapt.

Obviously I quitted\restarted vvvv - not the machine, to be honest, but this would not be the case, I thought -, and that behavior did not change - all regular with exceptions and nothing in tty.
I hope, next time I'll have that pc near to me, to say "Uh! It was something random..." - even if we know random does not exist.

Sorry to dirty the new core release post, though.
