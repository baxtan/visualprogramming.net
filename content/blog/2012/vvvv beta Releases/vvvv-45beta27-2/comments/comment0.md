Ciao, 

First of all, thank you devvvvs!

Then a question: did you changed something in the align (Ctrl+L) behavior? Till 27.1 the combo moved the last created\moved nodes. I found it's different in 27.2 and don't understand how to predict its behavior.

Buona giornata!

EDIT: This happened on a Win7 64. Now on XP 32 works as expected.
