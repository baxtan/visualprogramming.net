![](TodoMap.png)

this is the addonpack of beta27.1

with some great new stuff:
* the Midi/OSC Input/Output mapper on steroids: TodoMap by {{< user "vux" >}} (pictured above)
* a set of wrapper nodes around the [Open Asset Import Library](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/) which let you import a [wide range of 3d formats](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_formats.html). provided by {{< user "vux" >}}
* nodes for driving the kinect with either microsoft drivers by {{< user "vux" >}} or openni drivers, replacing the {{< contribution "openni-plugin" >}} contribution

{{< box >}}
Note:
if you were using vuxens {{< contribution "christmas-pack-2011" >}} or the {{< contribution "openni-plugin" >}} contribution you may need to remove them from your /contributions directory before you link that one in vvvvs root since they are now included in this pack.
{{< /box >}}

{{< user "unc" >}} improved some bits with the [TextureFX](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/topics/graphics/direct3d-9/texture/video-effects-(texturefx).html) and even included some new ones. 
and also check the 
 \addonpack\girlpower 
directory which has some new goodies.
