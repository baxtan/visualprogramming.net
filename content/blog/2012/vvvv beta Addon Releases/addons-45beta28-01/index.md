rendering by {{< user "unc" >}}

this is the first **beta28** addonpack. 

it comes with a bunch of new stuff by {{< user "unc" >}} regarding realtime cubemapping, ie modules for conversions between different formats. and {{< user "lecloneur" >}} spent you all a humble bundle of 30 [TextureFX](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/topics/graphics/direct3d-9/texture/video-effects-(texturefx).html) modules. just type his name into the NodeBrowser to see the list.

there is a new {{< node "TypeWriter (String)" >}} based on original code by {{< user "bo27" >}} that should come quite handy for creating onscreen keyboards.

besides that a series of fixes and new nodes by yours truly {{< user "vux" >}} and {{< user "woei" >}} as documented in the change-log.

remember: everything thats in the addonpack (and more) is open-source: https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk
