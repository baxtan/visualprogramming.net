I will use this opportunity again to suggest a quest for finding a more intuitive way of installing the addonpack. My estimate is that even when I show exactly how it is done, 25% of the students gets it wrong.

Couldn't we either have a "download and extract suitable addonpack" function in crack.exe or alternatively a little utility that did it that was in the vvvv folder?

I have heard that it has something to do with licenses that it is the way it is, but it would remove quite a lot of frustrations among beginners if it was made easier/more intuitive to install the addonpack correctly
