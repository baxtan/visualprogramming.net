Aaah. Okay thanks, didn't see it like that.

The addonpack folder in the addonpack zip having similar content to the lib folder leaves room for confusion, I will edit the addonpack installation page in the near future - if that's okay - as soon as I think of a way to clear up this possible misunderstanding in a way that is similarly concise as the current installation sentence.
