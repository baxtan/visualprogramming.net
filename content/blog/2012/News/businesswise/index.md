users of the vvvv!

helo.

we are very happy to see you all on our [map](https://legacy.vvvv.org/users/) which shows us that userswise we have the world pretty much covered. next up, lets see how many users of vvvv dare to declare their commercial usage publicly and by doing so potentially attract more business and local freelancers (and then [buy more licenses](https://store.vvvv.org/). see? winwinwin).

it is easy: if you feel like a business, go to:
{{< box >}}
[/home/business](https://legacy.vvvv.org/home/business)
{{< /box >}}
and add your business. fill out the form and place yourself on the map so that others can easily find you. for some details on maintaining your data please read the [business](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses) documentation, which explains how projects and licenses are being assigned to your business.

business or not, check back on the [map](https://legacy.vvvv.org/users) or on the [list of all businesses](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/) regularly and see it grow. find professional partners for your projects, find businesses that may hire you as a freelancer, show off your stuff.

thanks for your continued support. 
still more to come...
