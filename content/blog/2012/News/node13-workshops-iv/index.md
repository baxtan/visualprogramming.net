and some more..today i want to interest you into a first series of more applied workshop that won't necessarily focus on teaching you any specific patching skills but will rather guide you to do something with the skills you already have. 

**[Building Applications with vvvv](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/building-applications-with-vvvv)**
{{< user "robotanton" >}} came up with the idea of this workshop as he said at some point he had the feeling he now knows all the basics of patching but still found it hard to combine all his skills in a specific project. so in this workshop he will take you by the hand and step-by-step guide you through building a complete practical "app" that is in this case, a simple  viewer/editor for molecules..

**[Voodoo with vvvv](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/voodoo-with-vvvv)**
i think this is my personal favorite: there is this software called voodoo which computes the cameraparameters of a given live-video-footage. this can in turn be loaded in vvvv which allows you to combine the live-footage with realtime generative graphics. {{< user "milo" >}} will show you how..very much looking forward to your results.

**[IRIS - Interactive Realtime Image Synthesizer](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/iris)**
{{< user "eno" >}} and {{< user "ingolf" >}} have been working on this [IRIS](http://iris.nsynk.de/) thing for quite a while now and i still can't believe it is pure vvvv when i see it. basically it is a framework that lets you patch on a much higher level than you'd do when working within vvvv. so you prepare your content-patches in vvvv as you normally do, but then can use IRIS to more intuitively combine/route/compose those together...see i cannot even describe it in a meaningful way...go see for yourself...

**[Folding & cutting paper with vvvv](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/folding-cutting-paper-with-vvvv)**
vvvv is not only good for work on screen. {{< user "lasal" >}} and {{< user "ceeyaa" >}} will show you how you can use vvvv's svg-output-possibilities to create parametric paper-cuts that can be folded to three dimensional models..i've seen them, they look delicious..

thats only the first few....more applied workshops like those still to come..but tomorrow will see the publishing of all hardware-related workshops..
