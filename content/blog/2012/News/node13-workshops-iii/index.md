![](workshops.png)

now what do we have here...some workshops dealing with specific sets of nodes that all happen to have been brought to you by our king of code: {{< user "vux" >}}

**[Box2d - 2D physics based interaction](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/box2d-2d-physics-based-interaction)**
{{< user "elektromeier" >}} together with {{< user "tgd" >}} (creator of the {{< contribution "box2d-playground" >}} ) will show you how to use the [box2d](http://box2d.org/) physics engine in vvvv. 

**[Bullet - 3D physics based interaction](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/bullet-3d-physics-based-interaction)**
{{< user "microdee" >}} creator of the [LBRNTH](http://vimeo.com/35311617) and {{< user "gaz" >}} will give you a similar treatment but for the bullet physics engine. 

note that both box2d and bullet have a similar way of being operated in vvvv. so if you have only time to visit one or the other you should still be able to take your gained knowledge from one and apply it to the other. 

**[Kinect Basics](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/kinect-basics)**
**[Kinect Playground](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/kinect-playground)**
both of the kinect workshops will be hosted by {{< user "gaz" >}} and {{< user "lecloneur" >}}. first they'll make sure you get the hardware up and running and will tell you what data you get from the kinect and what you can do with it. the second workshop is more for playing around with some samples and realizing your own ideas.

and still more to come..we're not even half through yet..
