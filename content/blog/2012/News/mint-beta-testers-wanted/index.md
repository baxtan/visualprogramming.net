If you don't know what MINT is:

MINT is a framework for adding multi-touch support to your applications.
MINT takes care of multi-touch inputs and provides you gestures so that you don`t have to deal with their logic in your application. MINT comes with a set of standard gestures, for special gestures you can make your own scripts using Python. Gesture Scripts can be used in all supported platforms and are interchangeable.

The Documentation and detailed info is now online (<http://mint.strukt.com/doku.html)> and we are working on the documentation for the python functions that allow developers to create their own gestures.
