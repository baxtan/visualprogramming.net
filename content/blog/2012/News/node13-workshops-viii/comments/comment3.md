for the Rendering Techniques I workshop a DDI version of 10 will mostly do.
Rendering Techniques II will require DDI version 11.

you can check your DDI verision via running dxdiag (just type that into your start->run box) and then select the "Display" tab which will display your DDI version in the "Drivers" section.
