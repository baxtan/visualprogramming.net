and when you think there is no more...here come the final 5 workshops for node13:

**[Rendering Techniques II](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/rendering-techniques-ii)**
this one should be really hardcore. {{< user "vux" >}} and {{< user "dottore" >}} will tell us everything we didn't dare to ask about DX11 features like tesselation, geometry shaders, computer shaders and what not. definitely looking forward to get lost in this one. 

**[Software engineering patterns with vvvv](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/software-engineering-patterns-with-vvvv)**
being one of the early developers of vvvv {{< user "oschatz" >}} quite knows his patches. with support by {{< user "phlegma" >}} he will show you his favorite patching patterns. Recommended for people who still think patches inevitably have to look like spaghetti.

**[Using industrial robots for creative applications](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/using-industrial-robots-for-creative-applications)**
in the past years [MESO](http://meso.net) has realized a series of interactive installations using industrial robots. in this workshop you'll have access to a robot and {{< user "oschatz" >}} (of MESO) and Christian Goy will show you how to operate it. 

**[Foossball3000](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/foosball3000)**
for this playful full-day workshop {{< user "sebl" >}} and {{< user "velcrome" >}} will bring a soccer-table. together with you they will interactively enhance it. should be quite fun..

**[High-level multi-touch gesture recognition](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/high-level-multi-touch-gesture-recognition)**
[Strukt](http://strukt.at) have announced their set of nodes for multitouch-handling dubbed MINT a while back. in this workshop they'll tell you what they've learned so far about multitouch gesture recognition and discuss with you the roadmap of the MINT framework.
