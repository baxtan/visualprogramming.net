next up in the series of workshops for [node13](http://node13.vvvv.org) are our classics:

**[Rendering Techniques](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/rendering-techniques)**
for this workshop you should definitely already have patched around a bit. the questions you should have asked yourself already in order to gain from this workshop are: how can i write my own shaders, and how can i draw more objects at higher framerates. this will be a full-day workshop and as we think it will be quite popular with you we'll quite likely offer it twice...schedule should be up coming week. 

**[Boygrouping and Multiscreen Setups](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/boygrouping-and-multiscreen-setups)**
hosted by {{< user "joreg" >}} this is the one to book if you want to learn how to patch realtime client/server render clusters with vvvv. 

**[Dynamic Plugins](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/dynamic-plugins)**
hosted by {{< user "elias" >}} and {{< user "gregsn" >}} this is the first (of some more to come) coding workshops. it is targeted at people who know what code is, what variables are and have already written a for-loop. the course will teach you how you can make use of your coding skills without leaving vvvv. 

so, after having herby covered the basics, tomorrow some more topical ones.
