##  [schnellebuntebilder](http://schnellebuntebilder.de) is looking for motivated interns in the fields of graphic, motion and interaction design.
schnellebuntebilder is a design studio focused on animation and interaction design... just take a look on our website.

As an intern you will work responsively in current projects that might contain everything between music-videos and exhibition design. Therefore you should be familiar with the common tools of the Adobe Suite and/or software like Cinema4D, vvvv, Processing, (insert nerdy and exotic stuff here).
So, if you want to join the schnellebuntebilder-gang in Berlin for minimum 4 usually 6 month, donâ€™t be shy and send us samples of your work to [mail@schnellebuntebilder.de](mailto:mail@schnellebuntebilder.de).

keep on nerding,
