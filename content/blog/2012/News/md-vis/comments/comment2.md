nope there are 9 shared textures accross this setup (2 from the switchers and 7 between the mixer gui and the renderer) and there's no performance impact at all. there's no fps impact even when the shared textures are used on separate monitors.
it's fast as hell:D
and the sample dynamic plugin is completely spreadable
