mrboni: you have to download this release: [/daily/core/vvvv_45alpha27.2-dx9ex-8df41c80b957481c2322ae3513fb319e7970a5c4.zip](/daily/core/vvvv_45alpha27.2-dx9ex-8df41c80b957481c2322ae3513fb319e7970a5c4.zip) if you create a DX9Texture node and if that texture is used in an active renderer it's shared. the handle comes from a second output pin of DX9Texture
