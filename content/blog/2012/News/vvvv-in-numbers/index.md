users!

thought you might be interested in some stats. since those are really your numbers it's time to show what we know about you:

## webwise

according to google analytics vvvv.org had 313.075 unique visitors in 2011 compared to 244.010 in 2010. they obviously didn't get a download each (see below), so what did they do staying on the site for an average of ~4m30s?. around 22% came with an iOS and here is where they all came from:

| |**2011**|**2010**|
|---|---|---|---|
1\. germany|16.82%|18.22%|-|
2\. usa|11.36%|9.61%|+|
3\. uk|6.33%|6.81%|-|
4\. france|5.17%|6.28%|-|
5\. italy|4.66%|5.49%|-|
6\. russia|4.17%|2.58%|+|

of all visitors in the last ~7 years 4254 took the effort to register on our site of which ~300 have been logged in within the last month. watchout facebook!

the image above shows visitors of 2011 (blue) vs. visitors of 2010 (orange) where you clearly see that the [node-festival](http://node.vvvv.org) in november 2010 had quite an impact which is still lasting. this we can clearly not count as the devvvvs work. from the bottom of our quads: once again thanks to david and team (bow).
in case you wonder what those regular spikes are in the graph, here is a view on the month of august that clearly shows your completely consistend access pattern. you conservative weekend-lazy bunch!
![](august2011.png)
on a sad note, while firefox is still your favorite browser (37%) it lost massively since 2010 (47%) and instead you seem to prefer that kidsbrowser that is just oh so much better (from 17% in 2010 to 29% in 2011). ridiculous.

## downloads

vvvv went through 3 incarnations in 2011 with a total of ~32100 downloads compared to 4 releases with a total download count of ~45700 in 2010 (with its node-festival). in the same period the community maintained addonpack has been downed ~14400 times (~10700x in 2010). so if you're still reading, these figures clearly tell you that you're part of a dying breed. consider a tweet: #vvvv userbase down ~30% in 2011. long live vvvv.
apart from that i have no idea how anyone can work without the addonpack. i'd like to think of those that didn't get the pack as not actual users of vvvv. leaves us with 14400/365 ~ 40 real downloads a day. can we conclude from downloads to users per day? or new users? note to self: get those numbers up.

## licenses

in 2011 licenses/upgrades were bought by 61 different companies from 19 different countries (28 from 10 countries in 2010 and 37 from 12 countries in 2009. figures have been growing steadily ever since with 2010 being a particularly bad year with less licenses sold than back in 2007). 46 out of the 61 were new customers this year (18 new in 2010, 22 new in 2009).
that is so naice, thanks! no, not nice as in girl. it's your duty of course, you are just playing by the rules. so why thank you? (taking back the thanks). it's still nice to be thanked for doing something that you're obliged to do. thanks. or is it? (taking it back). thanks (taken) thanks (taken)...ah it is a tough one...
anyway you should by now be aware that by using vvvv you are also participating in a social experiment, which goes like this:

{{< box >}}
if you produce something of value and give it to people for free with the only restriction that they must pay you if they themselves make money using your product, will they do it?
{{< /box >}}

ja, obviously some will do, but our experiment has a flaw which makes it kind of useless. while we do have the numbers of people who do buy licenses we don't have any means to find out how many people actually think that power comes out of the socket. but since any way of tracking those would degrade the smooth experience (TM) of vvvvs legal users we couldn't care less to even spend a single thought on trying to do so. hence vvvvs only copyprotection is still the good old T.R.U.S.T.
given the following table of licenses sold per country and the above list of webaccess to vvvv.org would it be fair to conclude anything?

|**2011**| |**2010**| |**2009**| 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
1\. germany|48%|1. germany|43%|1. germany|47%|
2\. italy|27%|2. austria|25%|2. switzerland|21%|
3\. united kingdom|12%|3. united kingdom|17%|3. united kingdom|19%|
4\. united states|3%|4. russia|4%|4. austria|6%|
5\. austria|3%|5. switzerland|4%|5. italy|3%|
6\. switzerland|2%|6. south korea|3%|6. russia|1%|

(if your country is not listed: congratulations, you were the only one from your country to buy a license)

if you own licenses please don't forget to take care for them. note that under [My Licenses](https://store.vvvv.org/orders) you can see a list of all orders/licenses associated with your account. there you see a link to the download of the last vvvversion you may use with each of your licenses and from there you can easily update licenses. a license-update allows you to use all vvvversions that are being released within one year (since payment of the update). the latest vvvversion available within one year since purchase (of license or update) can still always be used indefinitely. 

## trivia

around 10 years in the making it should be pointed out that vvvv has been completely self-funded ever since. vvvv has not received financial support in any other way than through licenses sold and sponsered development of specific features. ie there is no EU/government/university money we would make our livings from. [meso](http://meso.net) the company that incubated vvvv in its early years is still the single largest buyer of licenses every year! we sincerely bow for that. and it is worth mentioning that vvvv has been quite a large donor to the node-festival, ie license-money is also being distributed back to the community this way, allowing eg for cheaper pricing of tickets.

so the reason for having to sell licenses is in fact the fact that we need to eat and drink (which isn't free as in beer). we wouldn't really mind running around naked though (if anyone gets the eat/drink thing sorted). 

if you're still struggling to decide whether to buy licenses always remember that it is for a good cause. and while you cannot claim it as a good deed it still reduces your taxes.

taxes. probably a good word to end the sermon.
thanks for being with us.
have a great 2012.
(buy more licenses)
yours vvvv.
