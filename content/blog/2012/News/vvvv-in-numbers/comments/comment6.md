webwise.
seems russia is most growning part of the community last year. cool. quantity should turn into quality one day!

downloads. 
my personal reasons to download vvvv more than once:
at home - using girlfriends laptop from time to time (every time download again :))
at work - last time pc worked it worked with OS only, so vvvv was deleted and i have no backup-flash-drive with me now.

licensies.
wow! i thought my licensies were from 2011, but they are really were from last days of 2010... guess russia should back in top6 in 2012. 
and if we compare licensies to the webwise, russia not looks so totally pirate country. that's good! but should be better this year.

thanks for advise!

p.s.
firefox rules!
