gaz, thats something i thought about too. when i started VJing with vvvv, the money i made a year with this was never enough for a license. an "artist" license for a lower price might cover this group of users.

since vvvv is used for so many different cases, maybe this should be reflected in the license scheme. educational / artist / professional ?

like the node festival tickets...
