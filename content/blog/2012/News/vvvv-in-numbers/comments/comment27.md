i think that too cause 500€ for somebody like me who doesn't earn money (or very few) from his vvvv work and is still to the bedroom visuals in housesharing point is quiet an amount. precisely the one of my soundcard which just died, or half the one of my videoprojector who's dying too (grr acer..), or the one i should put in my fiat panda for it not to be half-wrecked (still rolling though!)..
i don't want to make you cry or what but, yes, i'm quiet a [poor man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOWO9GwgjQ4) doing some vvvv for fun first and trying to transform it in a legal work or something, doing some unrelated jobs here and there to continue this way. I think/hope i'm not the only one.. If i was a company with mercedes or microsoft as clients i'd be glad to pay dozens of licences, but for now i just propose the support i can provide in return of what the community and devvvvs give, which i really care about and makes me very thankfull.

something between 100 and 200€ would already be something more affordable for me, not to feel too guilty of using naked devvvv's work.. (or i can send plastic bags, for sex-hiding when beer/food-buyin! works like a charm :)
