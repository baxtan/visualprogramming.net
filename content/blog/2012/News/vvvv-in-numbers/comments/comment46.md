Hi , sad to read statics are not great but do not surrender hopefully they get better ,people is more and more concern and the number of user seem to be increasing and learning fast. 

I vote for : 

-Extra effort to support the community now . 

-Gig license. For artist and small vj sessions . 

-Installment licenses . That could work in different ways a draft idea like you buy a week license for an event , if you buy 3 one week licenses in a short period like 40 days you get a full ,or some other way.

-Donation , indeed interesting and nothing to do with the license business. Many people may not ever make a commercial work ,but have been using vvvv getting the benefits and joy from the tool ,the generous ,kind and smart vvvv group and community . I,m sure many of them want to find a way to support it .

----------

kind regards and high esteem for the V-Community. 

Thank you and keep rocking ;D
