Some kind people made my thought explicit, but there's more, it's sure.

vvvv it's something you can say then I did it [my way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzQkX-IZDbQ), yeah [I sat there, stoned, mellow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNknFH6asAs), a [rough boom boom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOyj4ciJk34) from inside, and wow! more [food for mind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsL9UL9qbv8), and you know, a good state of mind is essential not to get lost and not being able to come back, even if it sometimes is as [sweet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8Tiz6INF7I) as possible, and along the road you may need [money](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqPhIJliWHA), you know I know, but you and I have to remember that sometimes [you can't lose what you never had](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWNgzbgrDe0), and... what the hell is [that](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFRMBWgyH-M)? [Where](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELLV-qzSgIo) am I? Where [I'm going](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ_-I7uEHek), too... What's the meaning of a [brand new Cadillac](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQQ_vl47CGc) in this room?
 
It's really too late... and I'm gone blue again...
