I feel that a lot of the members give their time and skills to helping users which is worth more than them buying a licences as it keeps paying licence holders returning! 

Donation idea is great.. but if you have a client paying for vvvv software, don't forget to add an extra licence fee on top of your fee for the devvvvs =)
