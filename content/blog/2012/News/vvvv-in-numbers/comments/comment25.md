U7.. There are quite a few developers here who earn a living from vvvv, but only just about earn that living. They're not business guys and sometimes asking for more money than the bare minimum can be very hard. If they give the community their time and awesome examples of work why should they not feel entitled to use vvvv for "free"?

An alternative to a donate button, could be a third type of licence - Artist Licence. Which allows you to decide how much you want to pay for the licence.
