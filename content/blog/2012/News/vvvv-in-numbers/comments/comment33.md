yeah sounds a bit raw.. with some truth in it but raw..

vvvv is experimental and opened to a wide range of horizons and if one want to go in a direction he can have support from others to go there and create something new, which will be implemented to next beta when done or shared in contributions section. Unc/Karistouf/Dimix (and others i forgot)'s collaboration around texture pack is quiet an example. Begins by an idea, competent and kind people gets involved, shaders are ready to use at the end and are implemented in addons or contributions. call it communism or anarchism or what, that's the way it's done till now.

I think there's already a lot of ressources and material to play with, maybe too much, so no, you don't have to necessarily code hlsl unless you want something special. 
In this case i don't see other ways to go deeper without coding, except if there was a node based environnement to use hlsl..

vvvv requires some self-involvement yes, time, and it's complicated sometimes, but the freedom you dispose worth it i think. 

Anyway it's not a product "customers" can complain about because it's not like this or like that. it's a collaborative/experimental/non-lucrativ developing experience and that's why it requires some self-involvement from the users to jump in and reach their goals. needs time, making some concessions about performance or stability sometimes (but beta 27 proves there's less and less of them, it's running pretty great!), heavy learning, sharing ideas and ressources to make the thing evolve (shame on me but i do what i can), kindness (cause we are na√Øve you know, we believe in friendship or something..). 

Multithreading is a known problem yes, it has already been pointed out and i'm sure it will be sorted out one day, but it's not that bad, with CPUs we have today you can still do great things, and i think you still can assign different cores to different instances of vvvv if you really want (didn't tried yet cause it's not my priority and a bit tricky but you can ask about that in forums, people will help you).

the fact vvvv's always evolving and going in different ways at the same time sure don't let enough time to devs to solve some problems like this one which would require big work to be solved cause they are complex and have to find a solution which would fit multiple different cases and uses. It's some heavy full time work i think, that's why it needs time=money, this topic is here for that, to remind users that if they want sharper stuff they have to support the thing in a way or another. it's not about pride i think, and if so, i think devvvvs can be proud of the work they have acheived till now.
