congrats devs!

personally, i probably would have donated for some smaller projects where i wasn't breaking even to begin with
and i still would have bought a license (+other licenses for client projects) if there was a donate button.

but i think in general it's a bad idea.

however, perhaps pricing / funding could be something to be discussed in a little group at Node
we're all behind the development of vvvv, and i think a bit of a 'focus group' might help. e.g. is the price right? what would make you feel happy about the purchase? etc. Perhaps even put some people at ease who shouldn't be buying licenses about when the right time for them would be.
