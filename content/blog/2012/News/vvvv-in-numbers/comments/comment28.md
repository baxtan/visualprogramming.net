I think there's also this site... I mean, the site is the "business card" of the devvvvs and vvvv.

I thought that to give something back to **everybody** in community I could add pages to the site. Who knows, maybe helps. I would do the same even if I got licensed.

This ain't a substitute to licenses and it's a tiny act, I know, but a growing, active community claims consideration. 

Everybody can give something to vvvv and devvvvs. One has just to find a way, if can't buy a license (which remains the first choice, obviously).
