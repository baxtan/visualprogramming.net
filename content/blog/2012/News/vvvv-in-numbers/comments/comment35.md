@aze: regarding the multithreading and GPU stuff, i've often wished that i could get into the native core code to see if i can track down some issues and learn more about how to things work in order to optimize patches. i know that the devvvvs are opposed to releasing source code for that stuff. i understand their reason and i'm not trying to criticize their choices, but there would be some benefits to opening up the same kind of community contribution in the native core.
