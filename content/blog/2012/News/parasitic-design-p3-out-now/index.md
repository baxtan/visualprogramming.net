helo again, 

here you go...some more parasitic design patches: 12 examples (ie. all but one bugger) of the P3 chapter of the [Generative Gestaltung](http://generativegestaltung.de/) book (also available in [english](http://www.amazon.com/Generative-Design-Visualize-Program-Processing/dp/1616890770/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1345550558&sr=1-1&keywords=generative+design) and [fran√ßais](http://www.amazon.fr/Design-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ratif-Concevoir-programmer-visualiser/dp/2350172155/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1345550741&sr=8-2)) transcoded into vvvv patches and documented for your learning pleasure.

P3 is the chapter about doing stuff with typography. so there is a lot of use of {{< node "GlyphInfo (String)" >}} and {{< node "TextMetrics (String)" >}} and {{< node "Text (EX9)" >}} in the examples. some of them use pixel-based text rendering, others treat characters just like quads for scaling and positioning them.

{{< contribution "parasitic-design-a-vvvv-beginners-cookbook" >}}

still more to come..
