dear beginners,

with the rise of [generative design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_Design) (and a bit late) vvvv wants to get its share of the buzz. so in its long tradition of copying the best it gives to you:

**Parasitic Design** a series of demo-patches with detailed explanations that closely resemble the output of their originals which are the processing-examples that come with the book
 [](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de) 
which btw. is available in english and french now!

over the course of the next few weeks we'll release most of the examples of their P chapter (>60) reimplemented as vvvv patches for your studying pleasure. they work nicer with the book at hand but also without the book you should be able to learn by just inspecting the patches.

looking through the examples you'll notice that some of them are not really suitable to demonstrate the strengths of vvvv. nevermind. those examples are there for all of us to find out more about vvvvs weaknesses. we left out only a few that we found too embarrasing to implement..

so the first 6 examples from the "Color" chapter are available from today. next week will see the drop of the "Shape" patches... subscribe to this contribution:
{{< contribution "parasitic-design-a-vvvv-beginners-cookbook" >}}
to be informed of all releases.

muchos gracias go out to the patchers who spent countless hours on creating, documenting and cleaning the patches for you: {{< user "roman_g" >}}, {{< user "ridike" >}} and {{< user "robotanton" >}}. plus special thanks for beta-testing and -critizism to [anna](http://www.kingkasimir.de/). and an extra quad to the generative-design-team for their kicking us and the mention in the english version of the book. horray. 

hope this helps,
yours devvvvs.
