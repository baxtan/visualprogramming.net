![](workshops.png)

tonight at first two more workshops for the advanced volks:

**[Particle Madness](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/particle-madness)**
the work of {{< user "dottore" >}} needs no introduction. together with {{< user "vux" >}} he will show you how he is going about particles. consider: everything you know is wrong!

**[Camera-Projector Calibration](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/cameraprojector-calibration)**
also the work of {{< user "elliotwoods" >}} is known around here. in this full-day workshop he'll teach you everything he knows about the togetherworkings of cameras and projectors. 

and here are two more of the workshops that allow you to apply your skills to specific tasks:

**[Motion Bank "Solo-Data Commissioning Project"](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/motion-bank-solo-data-commissioning-project)**
this workshop is led by researchers Florian Jenett and Scott deLahunta (of [motionbank](http://motionbank.org/)) with vvvv support by {{< user "zepi" >}}. they will tell you about the database of dancers motion they are creating. the api to access this data is not yet public but in this workshop you'll be the first ones able to access it and learn how to use that data to make visualizations with it.

**[Art and Brainwaves with vvvv](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/art-and-brainwaves-with-vvvv)**
{{< user "lanvideosource" >}} and {{< user "ceeyaa" >}} have both independently been exploring brainwave interfaces with vvvv for some time now. this workshop brings them together and they will let you know what they've found out so far about the noise thats supposed to make us tick and will let you work with the data yourselves.

if this is already getting too much for you to handle i am afraid, there is still a couple more to come..
