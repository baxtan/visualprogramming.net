Hey evvverybody.
Thank you for the nice feedback.
To answer all your questions at once:

Yes, 9 months is a long time but we need that to create a documentation and fix bugs. There will be a closed beta, if you are interested let me know.

A Linux version is possible, if there is demand we can think about releasing it for Linux as well.

We haven't made any decision on the license model but it will be similar to vvvv's license. Maybe there will be a few restrictions that will affect long-time commercial use without a license but there will be no locked features or other restrictions in functionality.

The MINT core will not be open source but we want to give everybody the possibility to extend MINT with custom gestures. 

I will post the complete paper as soon as possible and keep you all updated!
