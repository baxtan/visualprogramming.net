UPDATE: Documentation and detailed info is now online [](http://mint.strukt.com/doku.html)

MINT is a framework for adding multi-touch support to your applications.
MINT takes care of multi-touch inputs and provides you gestures so that you don`t have to deal with their logic in your application. MINT comes with a set of standard gestures, for special gestures you can make your own scripts using Python. Gesture Scripts can be used in all supported platforms and are interchangeable.

Every programmer who had to develop a multi-touch application from scratch knows how difficult it can be to handle many simultaneous interactions. Not only multiple fingers are used while interacting, but also multiple persons can use an application at the same time. Gestures can even be combined, for example to rotate and scale an object at the same time.

This can get quite complicated and it is not very effective to program the same interactions for every app so  [ Strukt](http://strukt.com%20) looked for a framework that is capable of a high-level handling of gestures. At the time there were no usable solutions available, but a research grant from the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) made it possible for Strukt in cooperation wit the Technical University Vienna to developed a very powerful framework.

The framework itself is platform- and language-independent but of course we focused on an extra-nice vvvv implementation. 

We are not ready for a public beta but we plan on releasing the MINT Framework at [  NODE13](http://node.vvvv.org%20)!

Here is a short demo video explaining the basic functionality of the MINT Framework, more can be found on the MINT website:
