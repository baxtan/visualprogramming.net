![](workshops.png)

as promised, today a listing of all hardware-hacking-workshops:

**[vvvv and the arduino](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/vvvv-and-the-arduino/)**
first of course the obligatory arduino training. hosted by {{< user "jens.a.e." >}} provider of the latest arduino-firmata plugins/module available in the addonpack together with {{< user "robotanton" >}} of [tinkersoup](http://tinkersoup.de).

**[The VVVVirmata Protocol](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/the-vvvvirmata-protocol/)**
this one is the logical follow-up of the above for those more interested in the details behind the ready-to-use plugins/module. here the same hosts will go through the firmata protocol with you and will talk you into writing your own snippets of code to extend it.

**[Motor Control](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/motor-control/)**
Sebastian Neitsch is one of those regular vvvvlers without a popular username but still knows his nodes quite well. together with his collegue Jan Bernstein he will show you how to operate different motors from vvvv. absolutely essential to the kineticist.

**[Projection mapping on moving objects](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/projection-mapping-on-moving-objects/)**
the boys from [grosse8](http://grosse8.de) have been posting videos in the past  claiming they can video-map rotating objects. so we thought we might as well have them over and let them show you what they are patching with.

**[let's vvvvly, copters](http://node13.vvvv.org/program/lets-vvvvly-copters/)**
not less obligatory in a way...there shall be a workshop to control those fancy quad-copters everyone is talking about. {{< user "woei" >}} is in the process of hacking one of those into a little plugin and in this full-day workshop will show you all you need to know to operate your own. guten flug!

and still some more to come..uff
