and the patching goes on..

this update to Parasitic Design includes all of the M1 (Randomness and noise) examples of the [Generative Gestaltung](http://generativegestaltung.de/) book (also available in [english](http://www.amazon.com/Generative-Design-Visualize-Program-Processing/dp/1616890770/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1345550558&sr=1-1&keywords=generative+design) and [français](http://www.amazon.fr/Design-g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ratif-Concevoir-programmer-visualiser/dp/2350172155/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1345550741&sr=8-2) s'il vous plaît). 

you may notice that some of the newest examples run quite slowly. this is due to vvvvs line module being a bit crap. still you should get the idea...

the total count of examples is now at 80. still more to come..phew..
