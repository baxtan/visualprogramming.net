ScreenLab in collaboration with the As Yet Impossible series of public lectures would like to invite you to an evening of artistic presentation and discussion at MediaCityUK. You will meet the ScreenLab 0x02 artists who will present the results of their residency at the 'Octave', the University of Salford's Virtual Reality suite, and its flagship facility at MediaCityUK. The evening includes talks from participating and guest artists, the opening of the ScreenLab exhibition, and a panel discussion to debate ‘favourable conditions for creating art of significance within contemporary digital environments’.
 
ScreenLab 0x02 involves three internationally-renowned digital media artists working in Salford to further the dialogue and techniques at the arts-technology crossover. By utilising the state-of-the-art facilities at the University of Salford, the artists will prototype new works and ideas, sharing their results and process.
 
The residency aims to facilitate artists to lead their own research and to develop their practice. Student involvement with the residency will enable them to gain valuable skills and experience.
 
The three resident artists participating in ScreenLab 0x02 Residency MediaCityUK are:
 
![](faceshift01.jpg) 
Kyle McDonald (USA) is a Brooklyn-based artist working with ‘sounds and codes’, exploring translation, contextualisation and similarity. With a background in philosophy and computer science, his works integrate intricate processes and structures with accessible, playful realisations that often have a ‘do-it-yourself’, open-source aesthetic. Kyle is a regular contributor to open-source arts-engineering initiatives such as OpenFrameworks, having developed a number of extensions which provide connectivity to powerful image processing and computer vision libraries. In recent years, Kyle has applied these techniques to problems in 3D scene capture, first using structured light techniques and later with the Microsoft Kinect sensor.

Joanie Lemercier (France) is a visual artist based in Bristol and runs the visual label AntiVJ. The focus of Joanie’s work is the use of projected light in the real world, and its influence on our perception. Joanie uses architectural projections, installations, stage design and audiovisual performances on stage. He has presented his work at electronic music festivals, public outdoor spaces and in galleries across Europe, South America, Canada, the USA and Asia, including The Armoury (New York), New Songdo city (South Korea), Nuit Blanche Bruxelles (Belgium), Breda cathedral (Netherlands) and Onedotzero at the British Film Institute London.
