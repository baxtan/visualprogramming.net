The second part of the workshop focusing on doing things in 3D space and explains some basics for that we had no time in the first part:

**basics & a bit more:**

-Subpatches: Organise your patches in subpatches. modularity, reuse your patches later.
-More spreadoperations: select, getslice, setslice, spectralnodes & binsizes etc.
-Multiple renderers and transform them to create large multiscreen projections. (example: projections on large buildings)
-Using the output of the renderer as a texture. Create an animationpatch convert it to a texture and use cool PostFX filters on it.
-Nodes for creating and manipulating textures.
-Filternodes, smoothly filter between changing values for creating nice and smooth animations.

**exploring 3d-space**
-Terminolgy (Mesh, Vertices, Texturecoords, UV Mapping, Indices, Normals etc).
-Using cameratransformations (perspective, position, orientation) on the renderer and animating the camera.
-Transformations in 3D Space
-About shaders and how to use them
-Mesh Import from 3d software (.Xfile, Collada)
-Having Fun with spreading in 3d Space
-A simple 3d mapping example on one or more cubes.


**If theres time&energy left:**
-Using Kinect to create interactive graphics
-Connecting vvvv to an iphone or android phone to control patches via OSC
-Connecting arduino to vvvv to use sensors, control Motors etc...
