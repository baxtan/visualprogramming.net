i'll be doing an introduction to vvvv at the t-labs of the tu-berlin: 
http://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/aktuelles/forschungskolloquium/
trying to argue that vvvv can make the world a better place for me and for you and the entire human race. 

if you're not interested in vvvv still come by, if only for the grande view from the 20th floor over berlin.
