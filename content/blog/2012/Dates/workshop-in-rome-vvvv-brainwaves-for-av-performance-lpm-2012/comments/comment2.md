hey guys, cool second part - I am doing some stuff with emotive but have problems to write my own csharp plugin based on the sdk and emotive csharp wrapper but v4 always crashes and i am not the coder guy more the patcher one. So I always have to use OSC via emotiveKit or Matlab. Does a plugin exists for v4 and does it work stable? 
I try to be in Rome in the and of May but now I am working in Beijing and not sure if I am back in Europe in the end of May or I have to be in Berlin. So is it possible to be there spontaniosly also when the workshop is full ;-) 

but lets stay in contact (ceeyaa@gmail.com) and I wanted to visit some friends in Rome this autumn. I am focused on DataViz, Modeling and A/V Performances

and THX for the “Tangible Feelings” symposium link - I missed it *damn* - I wanted to see the ArchiveVideos but China is blocking them or the connection is crap could be both here :)
