for the spontaneous ones based in **Calgary**: 

In the Coding Visuals workshop, digital artist Woeishi Lean will guide participants through hands-on activities and discussions covering a variety of topics from the ideation and development of media-enriched interactive projects, to theories of generative design and the application of various types of algorithms for design. This workshop will provide participants the opportunity to explore various techniques for augmenting projects through arbitrary input/interactivity and extending them beyond the monitor, mouse and keyboard. Participants are encouraged to bring their own concepts, or ongoing projects with which to explore, ideate, discuss and experiment.

The main tool for this workshop will be the VVVV framework (vvvv.org), an extremely powerful prototyping tool for visual output and real-time performances. Students should bring their own laptops, and those with Mac-based computers are encouraged to install Bootcamp on their machines so that they can install VVVV (it is a Windows-based framework). However, students can bring any other programming language / environment with which they are comfortable exploring (e.g. processing, openframeworks, cinder, Max/MSP, C4), as the discussions will pertain generally to approaches and theories of visualization for performances.

Pre-registration is required. Please reserve a spot by emailing Lori Miller at millerll@ucalgary.ca. Only 15 seats are available.
