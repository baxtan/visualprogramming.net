For example I was not able to install .net3.5 SP1. No way, for me, to do it. Then I pasted and copied the whole .net folder of Win inside Wine (er... cough cough...). I got that beta27 at least simply doesn't throw anymore any error, but stubbornly still refuses to start, stopping at splash screen.
