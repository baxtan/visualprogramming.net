Ni-hao Elektromeier.

First, congrats for this journey to the East (I've been in China, had nicely mighty spicy food, which I still miss, risked my life a couple of time, one time was nobody's fault, the other of the bus driver, bought wonderful hats, met a lot of westerns which were there to find a new reason to live on and a lot completely lost, met on a 6 lane road a Chinese engineer speaking Italian was saved our a*s*s, and you can't imagine what is to hear "Che piacere sentire persone che parlano in italiano! Ho sentito che avete dei problemi", and wow... personally was a so simple\complex experience... so say "ciao" for me).

Then, I read you're going to guide people to use vvvv through Wine, too. I tried a lot to get vvvv running on Ubuntu, getting nothing.

Can you please give me some hints on how make vvvv running on Ubuntu? Here I have Ubuntu 11.04, Wine 1.4-rc2 -got update really right now-, Mono 2.10.8, PLayonLinux 4.0.14, got .net etc. stuff from Microsoft.

谢谢
