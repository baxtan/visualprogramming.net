Unbelievably this is the sixth workshop I ll be giving in 2 years in Tenerife (a little island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean), it seems to me that an higher percent of unemployment is a good terrain for growing new interests... sadly enough.
Anyway, we ll start with a free and open talk/workshop the 8th of February trying to gather some momentum and get a few people to join a 50â‚¬/2days workshop scheduled the following week.
Where: that is in Tacoronte which is a small town in the north coast famous for its wine and black sanded beaches, in a cultural association "La Trilladora" run by one the vvvvorum member Carlos aka {{< user "vkmonitor" >}}.
