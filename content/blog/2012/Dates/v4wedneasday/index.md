Yup, hello,

V4Wednesday time!
<!--break-->
Its an open evening so come and show stuff or just chill and chat and drink, be social.  Like, whatever :-)

I've got a couple of things I'd like to see and do at Next week's V4W :- An Arduino overview and, inspired by Mr Woods, a Kinect-ReConstructMe-Projector test (I'll be sure to finally get the OpenNI drivers installed before that night).

Meanwhile expect some regular and slightly irregular, Processing faces,  sharing perspectives, stirring up ideas, and peacocking alittle, hopefully.

Look forward to seeing ya,

Hadasi
