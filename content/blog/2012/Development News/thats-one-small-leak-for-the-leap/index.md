As you know, the devvvvs never sleep and constantly come up with implementations of random stuff, which you have to catch up with.

We have been accepted as one of the first who get a free development version of the Leap Motion device. The device is not yet available, but if your lucky and also got one, you can use it with vvvv right away.

Leap will ship another 10k dev devices in the next week, you might be lucky. apply here: <http://developer.leapmotion.com>

Otherwise this is just a public announcement that the Leap SDK found its way into our code base.
