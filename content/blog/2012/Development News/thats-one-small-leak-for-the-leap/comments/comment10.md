The difference of this and Kinect is in accuracy really, and hand gesture is central obviously, as this video explains:

The Cobra sounds very promising but it's nowhere to be found and the company Canesta has been bought by Microsoft http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canesta .

But I agree that Leap is delaying their product...
