Finally got my dev device (and surely lots of you too). Could you update the Leap node to support the current SDK version, because it does not work right now unfortunately?

Thanks in advance and thanks for making that plugin available that fast! Would be great if at NODE the plugin would be working, because there will be at least a few leaps available for testing.
