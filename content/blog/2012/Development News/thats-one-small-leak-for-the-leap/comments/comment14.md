Great Thanks again tonfilm, I solve the problem it had nothing to do with screen/monitors or graphic card. The problem was the USP port wasn't giving enough power to turn Leapmotion on. Switched the USB port to rear ones and it worked instantly. Also the latest alpha and Leapmotion patch/plugin works well although jumpy. But that is something that needs correcting through the SDK. For now at least it is possible to experiment.
