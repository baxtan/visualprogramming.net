I finally received the Leap as well, but having problem with Display/Screen ID as it shows my screen ID as 0 and Leap is looking for screen 1, so nothing is happening. I'll have to try dual screen set-up later to see if I can resolve this issue. It could be different outputs from my graphic card Nvidia Quadro 4800 which is the problem. The monitor in my office in the university may not be the best, or even the graphic card configuration.

A bit disappointed that I had this problem straight from start, can't wait to get it working. I'll try it on the MAC SDK later to see if on Macbook pro it's different story (I think it will work there).
