helos,

this is the last call for testers to check the upcoming version of 45beta27.2.
instead of releasing all the magic that is cooking (and can already be tested in the [daily alpha builds](https://vvvv.org/downloads/previews)) we tried to create a build that only fixes bugs introduced recently.

**edit: fixed another one, so here are new files as of 02 05 12:**
so here is the [download](https://vvvv.org/404) and [changelog](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/core/change-log-vvvv45beta27-2.html) for alpha27.2 core.
and here is the [download](https://vvvv.org/404) and [changelog](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/addons/addons-change-log-45beta27-2-01.html) for alpha27.2 addons. 

if noone finds a big deal we'll make this the **official beta27.2 on monday, may 7h** and continue our ride towards 28. 

happy testing,
yours devvvvs.
