## UPDATE
we just fixed another bug reported by vux concerning changes on nodepins. 

this bug wasn't around at beta27.1 so we needed to remove that in order to be able to call it a bug FIX release... sorry for the inconvenience. 

the new versions to test are [alpha272.2](/daily/27.2/vvvv_45alpha27.2-develop-27.2-e8b00e16ee171f464236111a94af7b42126a881c.zip)  &   [addons](/daily/27.2/addons_45alpha27.2-develop-27.2-e8b00e16ee171f464236111a94af7b42126a881c.zip).

since the fix had to happen in the internals we need a longer test period.
please give us feedback on them until 4th of may and we'll release it as a beta27.2.

thanks!
