... great news !

not that i really missed 64bit features in the past, but it is always good to see that the core of vvvv is evolving. Thank you devvvvs !

unicorn ... 64bit ... maybe (only devvvvs might know) one of the next steps is multiplatform ( linux, mac, one ore more mobile platforms - android ? ) !?

But now to the main point of this post:
Wouldn´t be the step from 32bit-only to two betas in 32bit and 64bit the perfect chance/point for a general node cleanup within vvvv. 

I think a cleanup would be good/necessary anyways; who and how many users really use the ODE nodes or devices like Rebraun, OptimusMini (OK, i know who was requesting this one ...) and similar nodes !?
... and these are exactly the kind of nodes that are not working in the 64bit-version ... and some of them are not working perfect anyways ... and are only making code base unnecessary big.

In my eyes the only nodes that need a good replacement/alternative are the nodes in the freeframe category ... they would definitely need some replacements in a new future oriented technique !? I can´t say if and how difficult it might be to port them or something similar to another platform (shader, plugin ... ?)!?

Of course this cleanup would cause that some old projects/patches would not work anymore with betas >28.1, but i think the pros are heavier than the cons !?
... and wouldn´t be different node sets / functionalities in 32bit and 64bit versions simply be a future support-nightmare ?

Lets get rid of some old and only rarely used stuff if it is blocking/delaying future development.

Maybe i am wrong ... just my thoughts  ...
