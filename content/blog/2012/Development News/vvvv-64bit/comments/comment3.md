Tidy development seems still to be "active". [Link](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy/)
At least it should be possible to build it yourselves. It's a very useful node when dealing with "real-world  HTML".

edit:

[Here](https://github.com/markbeaton/TidyManaged/downloads) you can grab a rather recent (2010) 64-bit build of libtidy.
