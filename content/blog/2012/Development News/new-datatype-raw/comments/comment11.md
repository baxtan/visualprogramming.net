@oschatz:
next release introduces Skip (Raw) and Take (Raw) nodes. the former skips n bytes and returns the rest, the latter takes and returns n bytes. there'll also be a module called GetBytes (Raw) similiar to GetSpread (Spreads) using both of them.

@sebl:
what spectral nodes? i can only think of + (Raw Spectral), similiar to + (String Spectral) ... all the others are specific to values, not byte streams.
