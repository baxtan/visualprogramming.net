@Elias:
yes, i had a need for + (Raw Spectral). i thought there were more, but didn't have specific ones in mind...


aaand another thing:
i think it's often hard to 'see' the raw data, because iobox (Node) doesn't display them. Though every pin displays raw-values while hovering, that doesn't help when one wants to watch a spread of raws.

a possible solution could be a iobox (Raw) what essentially is a iobox (Node) but has the ability to display raw data similar to Value or String iobox.
what do you think, or how do you inspect raw data? always Asvalue (Raw) and an iobox afterwards?
