what happened to the ultra-handy {{< pin "Offset" >}} Pin of the {{< node "Ord (String)" >}} node in the new AsRaw (Value) implementation?   
the old one-slice-in one-slice-out paradigm proved to make quite simple patches when decoding binaries into its bits. 

{{< node "Tokenizer (string)" >}} should be available in a Raw variant
