+1 for IOBox (Raw)

This node would make debugging of device-communication much more comfortable.
Displaying the byte pattern hovering the output pin with the mouse in many cases is not really helping a lot. And even this is not working on the output pin of IOBox (Node) if Raw is used as output of a subpatch or module ( like for example GetBytes (Raw) ).

Another very basic node that is somehow missing in the raw-category is = (Raw), which also would be good (and logical) to have as a native node.
