finally, 

after quite some months in development and testing we are happy to announce the availability (in alpha builds) of **Player (EX9.Texture)**. It was developed in collaboration with and initiated and sponsored by {{< user "eno" >}} | [nsynk](https://vvvv.org/businesses/nsynk-gesellschaft-f%C3%BCr-kunst-und-technik).

The idea was to have a professional/highperformance alternative of playing back videos based on stacks of images instead of video files. The node is quite versatile/spreadable and does the heavy datahandling a background thread. Check its helppatch for instructions.
