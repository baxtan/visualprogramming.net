right. please check latest alpha which includes a new KeyMatch with a {{< pin "Keyboard" >}} input (and some more fancyness). so you can now connect a Keyboard (System Global) directly. also you don't specify keys in angular brackets anymore, but as a simple comma-separated human-readble list, like eg:
 Left, Right, Back, Return
