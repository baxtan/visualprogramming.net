@joreg/electromeier: /dx9ex texture sharing works also on 2 graphic cards here ...

But I have to right-click on the renderer node (close and open) once. It's the same when both screens connected to one graphic card (GeForce 770).

I don't use SharedTexture(EX9.Texture), but VideoOut(SharedMemory) and SharedMemory(EX9.Texture)

edit: Well, it seems I don't even need the /dx9ex for this nodes. Sorry!
