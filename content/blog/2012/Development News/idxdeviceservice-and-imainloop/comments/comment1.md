{{< box >}}quote:elliotwoods:
Can you confirm whether the events are fired before or after or unknown?
i.e. OnRender occurs after all textures are rendered? or before?{{< /box >}}
Me too, I'm interested in when ecactly the events are fired. I hope that this could help me with shared texture read/write synchronisation.
