helo herbst, please check 
[unicorn-in-alpha-builds](/blog/2012/unicorn-in-alpha-builds)
[new-datatype-raw](/blog/2012/new-datatype-raw)

you'll notice that {{< pin "Encoding" >}} for Reader/Writer (String) is now actually visible. but for dealing with binary files you'd rather use Reader/Writer (Raw) and not deal with encodings at all.

we are quite certain that the new raw-datatype will make it more intuitive to handle binary data. so please give it a try and report your findings on whats now there.
