Hi Joreg, as you said " that's fucks everything up" for me ! 

I really use a lot MySQL nodes .. for how long these node will be removed from vvvv ? In other terms, how long will I have to stay to the last "non unicorn" version of vvvv ? :(

I also used a lot RS232 node, so will try to make some test..

But despite this really bad news, it's great to see that vvvv is in a constant evolution.
