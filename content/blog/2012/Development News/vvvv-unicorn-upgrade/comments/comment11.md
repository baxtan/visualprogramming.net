sorry for not ranting earlier.. i completely agree with herbst here.. 

so you are saying the beauty of misusing strings as arrays of byte  (and the didactical beauty of having the difference between the two only in the visualization) is for now changed into a errorprone and subtle conversion step at all input and output nodes for strings? this doesnt really sound like an advantage tp me. 

and without the Byte node type (and the bunch of duplicated nodes like +(byte), the unicorn update will mostly disallow any clean binary data manipulation, right?    

this surely sounds like a showstopper, right? 

so please sell me some of the advantages of the whole thing  -  unicode with utf8 was supported for ages..  so whats the big plus?
