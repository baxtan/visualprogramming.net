great feature joreg!!! everything is getting much cleaner and elegant ;)
**+1 for {{< pin "Descriptive Name" >}} in {{< user "Server(vvvv)" >}}**
...as far as i'm thinking, it's the only way to have a flexible but robust newtwork with dynamic parameters assignment.
(you always know that this specific exposed IObox will always be "the size of this quad", even if it's OSC assigned tag changes).
the IObox descriptive name could be assigned into the inspector, in a "custom tag" section.
ciao 
:)
