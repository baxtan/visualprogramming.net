yes.

for now, i have a patch that extracts all descriptive names from all exposed ioBoxes in my setup and fiddles them together with the osc part before sending that whole list over to my controller (what is a patch on another machine)... that is like the opposite of elegant.

** so, i'd suggest that the most flexible way would be a {{< pin "Descriptive Name" >}} in {{< node "Server (vvvv)" >}}.**
(is that what kontrolleur does inside?)
