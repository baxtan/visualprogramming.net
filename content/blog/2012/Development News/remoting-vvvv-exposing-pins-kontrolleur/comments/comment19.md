Today I was looking at Exposing again and I have a few questions, because I am not sure if I missed something. 

1) how can I find out or even use the Tag of an exposed iobox? using it as osc address does not seem to do much good.
2) is it possible to extend the possibilities so it can handle Transforms, Streams and Colors? Can we do it or is it in the closed core parts?
3) why is the feedback only mirroring manual inputs but not ones that get set remotely?
4) i don't understand what the {{< pin "Cached Pins" >}} is supposed to do. Please be so kind and elaborate on that.
