Thanks for this really nice feature and it works like a charm! 

Since I am not so interested in android devices I wondered if it is possible to get a server-node on your control-pc to show the list of exposed pins from a second target-pc? Maybe it was my stupidity but I was not able to get this running... So I am now sending the server-list "oldschool" via udp(network client) to know whenever a new IOBox got exposed.

changing the "Feedback Target IP" does not seem to make any difference.
