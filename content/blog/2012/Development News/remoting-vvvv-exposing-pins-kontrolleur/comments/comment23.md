1) For me, {{< pin "Tag" >}} gets very powerful when you use {{< node "PinInfo-(vvvv)" >}} in order to group data.
3) I think {{< user "velcrome" >}} is right to expect feedback in any case. Since for sending and receiving we define different ports, it is the user's responsibility to avoid feedback loops.
