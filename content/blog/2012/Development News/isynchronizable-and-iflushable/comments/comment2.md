Hi Elias!

Many thanks for your answer and for all this vvvvunderfull new stuff!!! 

How do you recommend to use the new .net4 parallels library (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd537609.aspx) inside vvvv dynamic plugin?

Let's say we have one node (plugin) that has an enable pin. When enabled is set to [](1) it starts a TASK to read and process data from elsewhere, when the TASK is done it "load" the result into a FOutput pin via IOutStream? And the re-start the TASK from the beginning.

I want to use the new TASK library to do some things parallel and increase performance, also to make a "Task Template" that uses .NET4 Tasks and shared it, when I figure it out ;) I do not know the v4 internals and some directions will help a lot ;)

Many, many thanks!
