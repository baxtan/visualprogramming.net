Invitation to join the competition in the spirit of “Lumina”
 

The “Visual Music Award“ is a contest for young artists in the range of film and animation. We are looking for visual interpretations of music through artistic visualizations following the principles and the spirit of “Painting with time” and "Lightsoundsymphony”. The contest serves as a commemoration of the visionary vanguard experiments of the representatives of “Absolute Film” (.eg. Oskar Fischinger).

The 10 best out of the submitted music visualisations are honoured. Three winners will receive prices inclusively an exceptional price.

The three winners achieve non-cash prices. And as a highlight all ten awardees and price winners are invited to the price ceremony in the cocoonclub in Frankfurt (Main) in the course of the 10th eDIT Filmmakers Festival 2007. Deadline will be September, 9th 2007
