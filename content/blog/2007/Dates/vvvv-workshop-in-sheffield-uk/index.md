The School of Interactive and Algorithmic Art is proud to announce the first ‘Digital Summer School’ which is to be held over consecutive weekends in August at the Showroom Cinema in Sheffield (UK).

Subtitled ‘emergent languages systems and software for algorithmic and interactive art’ each weekend will focus on a different piece of software and is hosted by a leading practitioner in the field. The workshops are aimed primarily at professionals working in this field and require a strong working knowledge of interactive and generative systems.

On the 10th - 11th of August, {{< user "gregsn" >}} will be hosting a introductory workshop to vvvv.
