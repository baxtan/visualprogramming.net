The architectural installation, entitled “The Thing”, is designed by Städelschule professor for architecture Ben van Berkel together with Prof. Johan Bettum and Luis Etchegorry. The Frankfurt-based design-groups MESO Web Scapes and MESO Digital Interiors have developed a projection work that elaborates on the installation by dynamically embellishing it with moving images and thereby activating its surfaces.

The projection work, “On Things Off Things On”, is a case study in augmented architecture. It is an attempt to create a reactive surface of extraordinary spatial complexity.

Exhibition opening: 24 November 2007, 8 p.m.
Duration: 25 November 2007– 13 January 2008
