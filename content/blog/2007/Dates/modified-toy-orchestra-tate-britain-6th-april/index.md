The Modified Toy Orchestra are playing at the Tate Britain this Friday, as part of Cybersonica
[More Info](http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/eventseducation/lateattatebritain/lateattatebritain2007april.htm)

I'll be using vvvv throughout, bit of stop motion, bit of superformular, and a variety of other things!
The music is all made on circuit bent toys, and sounds like electro pop!
