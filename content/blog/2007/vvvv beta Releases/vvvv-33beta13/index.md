soso, what do we have here..
MySQL database access...ql, and all the rest is basically boring bugfixes again. but be sure to browse through \girlpower which hides some new gems.

we decided to have one more quasi-stable release before all the vvvvacko ahead. still too hot to be served...


make sure to read through the [Change Log](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/index.html) then get it from the [Downloads](https://vvvv.org/downloads) page and leave us some bugs in the [vorums](http://vvvv.org/tiki-forums.php).

bis bald.
