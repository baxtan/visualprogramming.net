Dazein Ltd. based in London is looking for freelancers who are able to work on multi-touch applications for events and permanent installs. 

You can work on projects from where ever you are based as long as we can discuss over Skype. You may be needed to travel to the destination of the install though, expenses of course will be covered.

All the necessary multi-touch simulator files for the surfaces will be supplied, along with content graphics, videos, etc. 

Preference for VVVV licence holders, so please state if you hold one when contacting me.
