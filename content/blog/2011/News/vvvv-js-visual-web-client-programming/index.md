Ok, it's not exactly what you consider "news", because it has been around the internet for two days already, but:

**Ta-Dah! The VVVV.js project has been launched -- now officially.**

VVVV.js is an open project, which aims to bring the visual programming language to your web browser, by porting VVVV's "runtime parts" to JavaScript. This enables your web browser to run VVVV files (or VVVV XML code) on the client side.

Get the full idea at the project website http://vvvvjs.quasipartikel.at

While this sounds too good to be true, here comes the bummer: besides porting parts of VVVV's internals, all the nodes you want to use have to be ported to JavaScript as well. Having in mind, that there are hundeds of nodes for the original VVVV, this is just absurd ... right? But let's just give it a try anyway.

The project is far from being ready to use in real life, in terms of functionality as well as in terms of performance. Its further development totally depends on your help. Checkout the Github repository at

https://github.com/zauner/vvvv.js

and help porting your favourite nodes, it's not that hard.

Juhu!
