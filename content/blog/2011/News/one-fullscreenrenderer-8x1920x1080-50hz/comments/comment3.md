cool, nice tryout Markus
so its possible to use more than one triplehead unit and the maxtor driver doesn`t get confused, I never tried.
What are your experiences with the framerate? Espacially PicturesStacks and Videostreaming - to stretch a image shouldn`t be a problem but at which resolution of a texture problems starts. 
Xp or 7 also good question - can you make this spanmode only with the ATI-Drivers - I read the Eyefinity supports Spanmode but in your case it must also support the Triplehead-units - so every Ati-Output detects the full Triplehead range and can be stiched by Ati-Drivers together?
