image above now :)

Doesn't support screenshots - hence the manual screenshot.

Just something really simple before going to bed (Quads are internal to the renderer)

Next would be Group node and external draw objects (e.g. Quad, Vertex Buffer Objects, shaders)

Then perhaps Transform compatibility, textures

Interopability with DirectX will be a little over my head (but is somewhat possible)

p.s. vux mentioned he'd done this before.
i'm just happy that i've got a new toy to play with

##  Why would you do this?
* Cross-platform (VVVV needs to get it's OSX on, ya hear me :) ?)
* Geometry shaders (They are pretty useful)
* Complete control over the rendering pipeline

##  But seriously
* VVVV manages so much about rendering, this is only for low level
* So far I'm using the windows forms wrapper which is fairly slow, fullscreen is proper speed. will get to that later.
