Hey Elliot:
this looks seriously good. Keep us posted about the development of this.

Just couple thoughts about the OSX port:
1-Because vvvv has a very minimal interface, i think the porting to cocoa would be quite straight forward. Of course that assumes that most of the UI elements will be done using objective-c.
2-an idea to porting some of the HLSL shaders might be to use Cg (i have taken a look couple times and they are very similar). The negative side is that, as long as i know, cg only compiles with NVidia cards.
