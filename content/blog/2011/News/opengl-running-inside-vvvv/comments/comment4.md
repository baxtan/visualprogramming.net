hi,

back to the root's ~ vvvv on linux opengl yep 64bit of course ~ get allways a nervous breakdown after 20min "vista experience" ;-)

and by the way the puedata community was on search for a replacement of tcl/tk interface ~ VVVV gui fo pd? ~ just a dream ... because i caught myself right clicking in puredata and a pleasing way to keep the "vvvv is not opensource" voices calm down.

wish you well ~ and keep on going
kiilo
