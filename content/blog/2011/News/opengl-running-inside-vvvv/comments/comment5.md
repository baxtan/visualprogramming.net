@dEp - WebGL is a decent graphics pipeline, but then other things will fall short for what i use (threading, devices, system specific features).

I think WebGL is very likely to be the main future of things like VVVV, processing, etc. But there will always be people who want something a bit more low level, and i think i'd end up with that curse myself.

That said, it'd be fantastic to get node compatability with vvvv.js, so full OpenGL pipelines can be run in both exe and js
