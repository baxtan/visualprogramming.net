At the Amberfestival (<http://amberfestival.org>) which takes place in Istanbul next week Ingolf Heinsch / milo and Jochen Leinberger / korriander will host a vvvv and physical computing related workshop. We are looking fordward to meet existing an new vvvv's in Istanbul. See you there!

**Workshop description:**

![amber festival - the human transmitter](amberfestival-workshop.png) 

No matter whether analog or digital, whether synthetic or organic - the recording, processing and transmission of information plays a key role in the formation and development of complex systems or organisms.
In a very playful examination, participants learn the construction and use of simple analog sensors as well as the use of digital-boxed versions. Thereafter the data obtained will be aesthetically represented using the graphical programming language vvvv. Afterwards this visual, sonic or physical representation will be transmitted to the next node.
The idea is to setup a cybernetic version of the common child’s play ‘Stille Post’ (chinese whispers), where the information is transmitted from one human / machine node to another. While transmitting an information from node to node the initial meaning of the information will change as well as the denition of the term “infomation” itself.
While collaborating in developing this network all participants will learn how to use sensors and interprete their readings in vvvv. 
**Tool of choice**
The programming language we would use within the workshop is vvvv. vvvv is a graphical programming environment for easy prototyping and development. It is designed to facilitate the handling of large media environments with physical interfaces, real-time motion graphics, audio and video that can interact with many users simultaneously. vvvv is free for non-commercial use.
Duration
 5 Days (all day (10 to 5))
Language
The workshop will be held in english.
