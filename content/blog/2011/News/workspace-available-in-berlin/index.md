#  What is 'Letters Are My Friends'?
'Letters Are My Friends' is a **concept store** for typography right in the heart of Berlin Kreuzberg. A place where analogue and digital type meet with emerging technologies. The first of its kind in Berlin.

One part of 'Letters Are My Friends' is a **cosy showroom** where letter relationships can be experienced in a physical space and progressive way.

We present applied typography in a dazzling variety: *peripherical perforated paper projections, spacy letterboxing, type'n'motion voxel folding, 3D ink raycasting, turntypetablelism, dolby surround fatcap-tracking, tasty toasted gpu fonts, trigonometric triangle trading* and of course some serious conversations about language, its aesthetics and the future of writing.

Moreover 'Letters Are My Friends' is a **research lab** and production label run by Ingo Italic and BÃ¤rbel Bold. We share an interdisciplinary and experimental approach to services and products related to typography, motion- and interaction design.

We love typefaces - static and generated, still, interactive and in motion, flat and haptic, printed, installed and projected. - And support their connections to art, science and technology. With 'Letters Are My Friends' we want to explore, initiate and feature projects that push type forward.

###  Co.SubLETTERS WANTED
Currently we are looking for likeminded fellows who share our passion for the well-dressed alphabet and don't mind having a beautiful renovated workspace together. We're looking for creatives who not just share a room with us but who are excited and passionate about this concept.

This means you are addicted to type, design, new media -like us-, and want to push this theme in an extraordinary way. We like open minded people with a grounded feeling for work and life and appreciate working experience (not a must) and reliabilty for a long time relation.
