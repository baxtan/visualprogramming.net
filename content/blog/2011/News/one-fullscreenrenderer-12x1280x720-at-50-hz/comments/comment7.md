wow!
so what's the deal with new hi end graphic cards?
regarding performances and compatibility
seems there's still some troubles with some shaders on ATI cards?right?

cons/pros:
* HD5870 2Go Eyefinity 6 + 6 triplehaeds allow in theory a 18 screen setup!
* GTX 580 Phantom 3Go : more memory (in my case i'ld like to extend the memory for preloading and Queueing textures )but no span mode under win7 
* GTX 590 3Go : dual GPU cards, no span mode, texture sharing is not possible so only one of the 2 unit is used (disabling SLI) does that mean that only the half of the available memory is used too?
