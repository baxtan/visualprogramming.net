haven't given up on this. The 590 DOES support span across 3 ports in windows 7. Span mode is back in windows 7! It's called Surround 2D. Currently having trouble with another graphics card in the system too. Fingers crossed can get 3 triple heads spanning. Read [here](http://www.nvidia.com/object/3dv-system-requirements-surround-technology.html) about requirements for Surround (2D).
