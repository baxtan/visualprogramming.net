![NODE10 Forum for Digital Arts](node%20header%20gra_r.jpg) 

The second edition was held in November 2010 in cooperation with the Frankfurter Kunstverein (fkv.de). Through the exhibition and lecture panel 'abstrakt Abstrakt - the systematized world' (curated by Marius Watz & Eno Henze) we seeked to analyze the nature and effect of abstraction systems. 

With an unbelievable longlist of vvvv workshops we made heads spinning and with the performances we created astonishment. NODE10 was a week long highly creative rush of discussions, theoretical and practical lectures, workshops, presentations and events.

Thanks everybody who made this week in November 2010 such a good time.
