[Lumacoustics](http:\\www.lumacoustics.co.uk) is looking for a full time software developer who specialises in vvvv to work in our London studio in a nice location, just east of the city center.

Among other projects, we’ve currently working on a number of digital elements, both visual and interactive, for an exciting major brand’s flagship store in London. We're also constantly working on our product [YrWall](http:\\www.yrwall.com) and have some really exciting things happening with that over the next few months.

Our work is extremely varied and we're looking for someone who learns quickly, enjoys a challenge and has previous experience with different aspects and techniques of visual computing. Primarily you must have a keen eye for design and aesthetics but also a good understanding of vvvv.

Although you'll mainly be working in VVVV, someone with previous Adobe Flash, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, C#/++ and general hardware experience would be a big plus.

Please email a CV or weblink to jobs@lumacoustics.co.uk. 

Of course if you have questions about the role please email me. Salary depends on previous experience. 

Also, we’re always looking for good talented people to come in on a 3 month paid internship so if you don’t quite fit the description above there still may be a role here for you so please get in contact. 

Also, we often work with external freelancers so if you're one please offer your services to us.

Thanks,
