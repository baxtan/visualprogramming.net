dir alpha patchers,

let us introduce you to a new service: from now on you have direct access to our daily alpha builds. The second we push code to our repository our server builds new packs (core + addons takes it around 5 minutes) and puts them [online](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews) for you to test. ...and we call those "ahead of time builds" (but you may also refer to them as "alphas").

Please test them heavily and report issues only in the new dedicated [alpha forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/) or on [IRC](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/chat.html). We don't want to see any alpha-talk in the normal forum in order not to get people confused. The [beta download](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads) is still the only one official that is supposed to be discussed in the beta forum. 

For those who want to come even closer please checkout the [vvvv-sdk](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/devvvveloping/vvvv-sdk.html) which allows you to build all public sources of vvvv (including the whole addonpack) yourself with just a few clicks. This allows you not only to test the latest builds but also to fix bugs and contribute back to vvvvs repository. 

The more you test and report, the more stable our beta releases will become. So thanks in advance for your efforts and happy patching.

yours,
devvvvs.
