Reread joreg's (when I was reading it the first time I didn't realise it was joreg).

Realise it was more of a statement than a discussion :)

I am suggesting to scrap the addonpack and replace it with something else. But I'm not going to stomp feet. I totally appreciate people who love the addonpack. And will give it more time than I do at the moment.

I would like a response to the above suggestion though (including standardising a resource to a folder with the outline as above).
