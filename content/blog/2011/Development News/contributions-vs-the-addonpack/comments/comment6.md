i didn't mention the "resource" idea in my outline. i'd still call them addons though. and addons should of course be able to consist of more than a .dll and therefore be able to have their own (but standardized) subfolder structure. yes, this is missing and needed. 

but as vux points out it will work well together with the pack. even such substructured addons will best be inside the oneclick download pack for the users convenience. 

the idea of an upload/downlod package-manager i think is more of a developer fantasy. this is how we'd love to do it right. only making it more than a proof of concept (checking dependencies...) will take a lot of effort which we users wouldn't care for. for us users (as vux pointed out) it would be much more important to get a better overview of whats there. this is were the nodebrowser and the [node reference](node%20reference) are lacking, not a package-manager. 

so yes, we're basically on the same track with the resource/structured-addons idea..just not implemented yet.
