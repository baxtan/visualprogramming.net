The resource idea is quite nice actually, since lot of distributions might include more than just plugins (often you need a plugin + a few shaders for example). In some ways that would not be incompatible with the addonpack, they could work well together.

I still like the idea of a "static" pack, since auto download sounds good on first instance, if i need an addon in a place with no internet (that still exists ;) , then there's no way to download it.

Doing an internet check is fun for developing, but on a permanent install i got a stable release and I want to leave it as it is, so having internet check for version would just slow down startup time a lot (having it as a global option is cool tho).


The biggest problem i see with addonpack is not really knowing what's inside, i'm sure some people (including me) coded a plugin for something to realize afterwards it was already done. Eventually having some form of installer with a description for each plug would be useful (like standard installer does, you can select features).
