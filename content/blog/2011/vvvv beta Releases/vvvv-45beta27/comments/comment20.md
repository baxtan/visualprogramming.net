Finally had some time to play with it. In the past i could not agree more on general performance and stability erosion since beta 23 brought up in some forum topics by vvvvellow users, but first benchmarks suggest that this version is running cycles around b26 in means of gui and overall performance, so i'm a happy camper now! :)

My highest praises to our beloved devvvvs and contributors!
