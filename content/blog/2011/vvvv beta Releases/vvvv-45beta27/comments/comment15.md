@microdee: we have that dx9ex in one of our branches of development. 

We were very focused on seperating between developments that are ready to use and others that still need to be worked on. In the future we will try to avoid situations where a release brings new features together with new problems. So this is release is more focussed on getting rid of problems, stability and performance. As soon as we think that a certain branch of development is ready to be integrated we will make that available in our alphas to be tested for some time, before we make it available in a future release. That way you will gain from our famous high beta product quality level!
