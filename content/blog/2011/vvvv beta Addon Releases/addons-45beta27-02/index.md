{{<previousRelease>}}


this is beta27s addonpack. 
*(2nd service. now also including stuff accidentally missing from the first pack, like Box2d nodes)*

it includes updates by {{< user "unc" >}} for [TextureFX](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/topics/graphics/direct3d-9/texture/video-effects-(texturefx).html) (textures now keep their formats through each module), there's been a rework of the phidget nodes by {{< user "phlegma" >}} and {{< user "woei" >}} has spent us some nice new nodes + some more stuff. it is all (supposed to be) in the changelog. 

muchos gracias to [all contributors](https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk/contributors). 

not enough new stuff you say? consider this the calm before the storm...
