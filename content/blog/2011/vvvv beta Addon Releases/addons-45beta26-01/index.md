as usual the addonpack is stuffed with great bytes by vvvvs regulars {{< user " vux" >}}, {{< user " woei" >}} and {{< user "phlegma" >}}. keep it up bois! please consult the [addons change log](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/index.html) to see what they came up with.

also this time is a first for {{< user "unc" >}} who makes his debut with sharing a mere ~50 (stopped counting there..) effects/modules for image manipulation. it is hard to fit into superlatives what he did in the last two months after he stumbled on {{< user " karistouf" >}}'s quest for easy image treatment possibilities: [forum](forum)

[TextureFX](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/topics/graphics/direct3d-9/texture/video-effects-(texturefx).html) is in a way comparable to [freeframeGL](http://freeframe.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freeframe/trunk/docs/specification.html) as it is a specification of how to prepare vvvv-modules for texture-manipulation in order to make them work together nicely. only apart from the specification it also already comes with a fairly complete implementation right in this addonpack. in the nodebrowser just check for "filter", "fx" or "unc".

this needs to go out to the world, so i prepared a little press-statment:

{{< box >}}quote:vvvv:
~np~#~/np~texturefx for #vvvv by unc is one of the most extensive GPU-based, opensource image-manipulation and -analysis packages available.  
{{< /box >}}

see, i made this <140 characters for your tweeting pleasure. people interested herein were also interested in [unc's videos on vimeo](http://vimeo.com/unc/videos)

now go ahead download, test and report your findings on the [forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/).
