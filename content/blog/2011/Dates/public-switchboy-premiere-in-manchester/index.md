Join [intolight](http://www.intolight.de) for an informal laptop workshop and powwow for anyone interested in creating interactive and immersive environments. We will present the brand new Switchboy!

Switchboy is a vvvv-based software VJ-Mixer for the easy collaborative creation of reactive environments at festivals and public events. With an easy-to-use software framework, interactive and immersive environments can be created almost instantaneously. Once set up in public spaces, the input of audio analysis data, motion-sensing data or any other input from interfaces opens the system to the physical world.

The workshop will be hosted by [Marko](http://www.intolight.de) aka velcrome, [Johannes](http://schnellebuntebilder.de) aka clay and [Jacob](http://www.jacobkorn.de)
