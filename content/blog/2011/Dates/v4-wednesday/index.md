![V4W-June29th](June-29th---Sune.jpg) 

V4Wednesday: a master class with Sune of Motorsaw.

Sune Petersen's dropping over to London for a short stop so he's going to swing by the cauldron of V4W to reveal the secrets of his work.

The evening will start with an introduction and a demonstration of Sune's work, followed by an exploration of philosophy behind it, a chance to have a play + a Q&A.

More details available <a href="http://www.v4wednesday.com/2011/06/event-29th-june.html" >here</a>

Thanks

Hadasi
