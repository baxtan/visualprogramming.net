In this site specific installation a second room is superimposed on the 22Presents showroom. The skeleton of the space is shifted into a different perspective and outlined on the walls.
Focussing on the transformation of one perspective into the other the space between the two is explored through iterative processes. The infinite variations and states of the process are reflected in generative laser drawings.
The sound creates a constantly changing environment. Space is made perceivable through moving relatively static sound sources across a special loudspeaker setup. Different sound beams scan the room and explore its spatial properties.

Praxis is a collaborative workspace located in Berlin that houses a collective of likeminded people and friends working in the fields of New Media Art, Audiovisual Art, Interaction Design and Programming. Praxis started out in 2009 in Oranienstraße, Berlin Kreuzberg. The founding members were Sebastian Gregor and joreg (vvvv group) who then teamed up with visual artisits Rainer Kohlberger, Claudia Rohrmoser and sound artist Wilm Thoben. The VVVV crew was then joined by two more helping hands, Tebjan Halm, Elias Holzer.
