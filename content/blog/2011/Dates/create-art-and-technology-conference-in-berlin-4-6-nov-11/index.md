From 4th to 6th November „Create. Art and Technology“ brings together artists, coders, designers and engineers in Berlin. It is a conference about making new things in a new way. 

How to vvvv and lasercut? How to combine sensors, motors and Arduinos in a functioning prototype? How to process a certain kind of material? In talks, workshops and „How I did it“ sessions insiders present fascinating projects from the first idea till implementation. Experts talk about cnc machines and material procurement. Artists present their new electronic instruments.
