Elliot Woods of Kimchi and Chips ([](http://www.kimchiandchips.com) is looking to put together a beginners VVVV workshop to take place sometime after July 2011 in Manchester.

We'll be coverering the basics and lean into Projection Mapping and Kinect.

Currently we're trying to gauge interest for this. If you think it's something you may attend or have some comments about what you'd like to learn, then please leave feedback at.
