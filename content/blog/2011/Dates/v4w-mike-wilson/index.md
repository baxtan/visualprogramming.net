Hi folks,

We've got Mike Wilson doing a talk and show techniques he's using for his amazing <a href="http://www.newoperahero.com/" target="_blank">New Opera Hero</a> Project

New Opera Hero amalgamate visual and sonic art into audiovisual anthems for the future - a band connecting live music, visuals and technology within stunning live performances.
N.O.H. was formed in 2007 by Steff Ungerer and Mike Wilson who have directed, composed, written and designed for theatre, opera, concerts, TV, computer games and art installations for more than ten years. As founders of <a href="http://www.burst-tv.net/" target="_blank">burst tv London</a>, their credits include work for the National Operas in London, Tokyo and Hamburg as well as shows for established acts like the Pet Shop Boys, Lady Gaga and Asian Dub Foundation.
They will be showing some footage from their shows and demoing how they use vvvv to sync multiple holographic projections, lighting using dmx and audio, with some realtime reactive elements.


Please email to reserve a space as seating is limited, but we should have standing room. Talk begins at 20:00; vvvv beginners can pop down from 7 if you need any help. email hayden-at-v4wednesday-dot-com for this or any other matters.

Thanks Hadasi

PS: Well done to Andy McWilliams who triumphed over Lightmare in the Patch Slam. and thanks to Gaz and the other contributers for a fun event. More on that soon.
