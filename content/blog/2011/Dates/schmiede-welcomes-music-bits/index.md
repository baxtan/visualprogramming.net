our friends from [schmiede](http://schmiede.ca) mentioned something that could be of interest to some of you:

![](Schmiede%20welcom_r.png) 
"Schmiede welcomes [Music & Bits](http://musicandbits.com/)" will happen on the first Schmiede11 weekend (16th and 17th of September) and is an open festival within Schmiede. Music and Bits is an event focused on creating web applications around music and technology. From building iPhone apps to art installations and web applications - everything is allowed as long as itâ€™s music related and build within a very limited amount of time.
