We got more feedback on VL since beta35 and we are really really happy about that! It's true. True! 
And since you know how much we dig VL, you will believe me, even though i did everything to sound silly. Besides, also some vvvv issues were reported.

While this is not meant to be the biggest release ever, we still took the chance, addressed some of them and dropped the improvements into a maintenance release, just to make sure to get back to a faster release cycle.

Besides all the fixes that actually make you want to use this release, here are some additional small features:

* vvvv: Patches/modules can now be cloned like plugins via ctrl+click in nodebrowser.
* VL: Drag a link and a point will be inserted.<!--~~~-->![](WIXR4eVTBE.gif)

Note:
One note on this version for users that already used VL: We took the chance to do small modifications of the model. When saving your documents with this new version this will result in VL files that beta35 can't read. So please test your project with the new vvvversion, make sure everything runs fine and try to not to return to an earlier version. We'll try to keep the model more stable in the future.
