A few more glitches came up right after the [last release](/blog/2017/vvvv50beta35.7), so here we go again, welcome beta35.8!

The most important fix is that the code completion in the C# editor works again (thanks @vux for reporting). It was kinda broken since beta35. All the other fixes [target mainly VL](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/index.html) (thanks @bj√∂rn).

And here are some more highlights taped for you:
