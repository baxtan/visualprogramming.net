helo everyone and welcome to this past months recap.

NODE17 is heavily in the making. the [list of workshops](/blog/2017/node17-workshops-announced) is nearly complete and [festival passes are already on sale](/blog/2017/node17-festival-passes-finally-on-sale)! vvvv and vl are getting ready for their big appearance..

fresh from our labs you got [vvvv50beta35.5](/blog/2017/vvvv50beta35.5) whose most important changes i summarized for you in [this video](https://vimeo.com/215358621). if you're more the reading type and into vl make sure you don't miss those three blogposts:
* [XML and JSON nodes](/blog/2017/vl-xml-and-json-nodes)
* [Event based Midi](/blog/2017/vl-event-based-midi)
* [Reactive Programming](/blog/2017/vl-reactive-programming)

we're planning one more release early june that we'll want everyone to use at node. not sure yet, if it will include the promised vl-node-importing features but we'll definitely have those available at least in alpha-builds.
