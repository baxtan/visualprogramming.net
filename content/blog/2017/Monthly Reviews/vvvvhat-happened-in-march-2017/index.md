aaand here is what happened in march in vvvv-land:
- we now have a dedicated [jobs category](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/jobs) in the forum
- we announced the first batch of [workshops for node17](/blog/2017/node17-workshops-announced)
- the [editing framework got an update](/blog/2017/editing-framework-update)
- you can now create [test patches](/blog/2017/test-patches-for-vvvv) for vvvv

and sneakpeak: we're on the finishing touches for XML and MIDI-IO nodes for VL which we hope to have in alphas shortly (you'll love them, trust me for once). in parallel, as [mentioned before](/blog/2017/devvvvlopment-update-january-2017), we're still working on making the importing of libraries super comfortable for everyone. think: drag-drop...
