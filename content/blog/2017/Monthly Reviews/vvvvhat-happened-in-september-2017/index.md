heidiho, 

here we go..all devvvvs are finally back in office after a few weeks of...recreational activities. and powered by our new patcher-in-residence [guest](https://discourse.vvvv.org/users/guest/activity) we're in full swing. Finally officially announced [the big thing](/blog/2017/vl-using-.net-libraries-and-writing-custom-nodes) we've been working on for quite a while now. It turned out gorgeous if I may say so. Fully equipped with documentation it is now on you to give it a shot and tell us what you think.

Next up: beta36 and a few little gems on the way..speaking of which we're released our work in progress on a [UI library](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-ui-library/15679/1). Nothing too fancy yet, but a rather solid groundwork already.

{{< user "dottore" >}} updated us on his work on [Kairos](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/kairos-software/15506/17) which we power with a solid base layer as vl.

And in vvvv news it seems we finally found the culprit of the [~temp.v4p problem](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/patch-save-error-with-message-this-time/15600/8) and also provide a solution to the recent  [saving woes](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/save-all-also-saves-root-patch/15670/13).
