I know I know, I was developing them for a need of a project with a deadline (also there's a QuickGraph and a GraphSharp implementation for the same project). I didn't have time for a more articulate blogpost and kinda forgot about them later. I'm planning to start making a documentation overhaul about my packs after I finally release FBX4V.
