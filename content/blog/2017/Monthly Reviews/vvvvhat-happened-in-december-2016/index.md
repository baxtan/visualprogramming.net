oh,

what a ride that past 2016. and already 2017, the year of the next NODE, is in full swing. just in case you live behind the moon and this is the first post that reaches you in a while, learn this: [vvvv 50beta35](/blog/2016/vvvv50beta35) plus [addonpack](/blog/2016/addons50beta3501) is out now. it ships with vl and is gorgeous (in that it had >1000 downloads in the first week and no substantial bug report to day, yay!). can't be bothered to read through the annoucement? [watch the video](https://vimeo.com/196671562).

Also we [shipped the pandas](/blog/2016/and-the-pandas-go-to) and are [calling for NODE17 workshops](/blog/2016/node17-call-for-workshops)!

## What the VL?

Well, it is out, use it! let us know how it works for you, or why it doesn't and what you're missing. but first read our latest blogposts to know what you're working with:
* [VL: Progress Report /4](/blog/2016/vl-progress-report-4)
* [VL: Many Paths lead to Rome](/blog/2016/vl-many-paths-lead-to-rome) 
* [Zoom Pan Rotate Touchgestures](/blog/2016/zoom-pan-rotate-touchgestures)

Next to continuing with smaller updates and fixes we'll now be assessing the next big steps ahead. beta35 feels like a good base to build onto. more details as we've decided on directions..
