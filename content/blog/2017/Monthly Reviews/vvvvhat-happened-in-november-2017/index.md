dear patchers worldwide,

## vvvv/vl

another month has passed without us releasing the long promised beta36. reason: the things we've planned for it to include, are not finished yet. as [mentioned previously](/blog/2017/vvvvhat-happened-in-october-2017) the main focus of this release is to get the workflow right, for using/wrapping external .NET libraries in vl. people using [latest alphas](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews) already have the possibility to do so. basically any .NET library can now be used in vl directly via drag'n'drop. this is huge and on the other hand feels so natural that it is also not a big deal and will and should be taken for granted from now on. when developing plugins for vvvv was still kind of a pro-thing, even though we had easy dynamic plugins, it is now a no-brainer with vl and i predict that everyone will do it casually at some point. so again, please test with latest alphas and report your findings in the [chat](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/chat.html) or on the forum (with tag "alpha"). thanks for the more and more vl-related issues there and on the chat recently!

but then that is not all. obviously. besides [adding C#6 support for dynamic plugins](/blog/2017/c6-compiler-for-dynamic-plugins) we've also made quite some fixes to vvvv and vl as you can see already in the (not yet complete) [change-log](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/index.html).
