and there it was already over, weird february..

in our quest to arrive at a more regular release cycle we gave you [vvvv 50beta35.2](/blog/2017/vvvv50beta35.2) just about a week ago. it doesn't come with much new stuff but since it has a lot of little fixes it is definitely the version to use now.

vl is going strong. at least on our side. but also more and more of you are eager to get into it as we can see in related forum questions. the discussions there already proof to be valuable sources of knowledge, so we're collecting a few interesting ones for you here:
