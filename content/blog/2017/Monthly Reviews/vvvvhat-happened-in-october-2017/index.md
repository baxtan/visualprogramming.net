what a month!

you may want to make yourself comfortable before diving into this. summertime is over and everyone is back patching in their cavvvves. a lot of beautiful things happened in the past month. here we go:

## vvvv/vl wise

our main focus is still getting beta36 out, which will include the new and trivl way to develop nodes for vl as already mentioned here [last time](/blog/2017/vvvvhat-happened-in-september-2017). just still not happy with all the details. we'll get there eventually.. but meanwhile also a few other things happened that are ready for you to test in latest alphas:
- the VL.Experimental package now includes reworked UDP nodes that will soon leave experimental status and are already being used under the hood now in the ArtNet (Network Sender/Receiver) nodes in vvvv which makes them faster.  
- also new in experimental: RS232 nodes for vl which will power the FirmataBord (Devices) in vvvv soon to also make it faster.
- [Custom Dynamic Buffers](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-custom-dynamic-buffer/15703) allow you to fill textures for DX9 and DX11 and DX11.Buffers directly in vl for later use in vvvv. this should have quite some potential...
- work is under way to wrap the [DigiCamControl](https://github.com/dukus/digiCamControl) library for vl which allows you to control quite a [wide range of cameras](http://digicamcontrol.com/cameras)
- we've resumed our work on wrapping [Skia](http://skia.org/) for vl which will provide us with its first rendering engine. 2d only but already looking promising..we hope to be able to show you something soon.

*pin editors landed in vl*
- if you want to get started with vl as a longterm vvvv user, please read [vl for vvvv users](https://vvvv.gitbooks.io/the-gray-book/content/en/VL_for_vvvv_users/VL_for_vvvv_users.html) as an explanation to how it should be understood and an introduction to usecases it can help you with 
- vvvv got a nice feature on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2017/10/26/interactive-visual-programming-with-vvvv/), thanks!
* we had some [recent changes to the website](/blog/2017/website-updates-3)
* fixes for the I2C firmata nodes: [firmata-updates-and-fixes](/blog/2017/firmata-updates-and-fixes)
* HTMLTexture can now talk to vvvv via javascript, see girlpower\IO\Web\10_JavascriptToVVVV
