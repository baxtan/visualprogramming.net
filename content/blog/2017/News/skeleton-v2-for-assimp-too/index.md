SkeletalMesh (DX11 Assimp) and SkeletonSimple (Assimp) in mp.dx are now using the Skeleton interfaces V2 implementation. This means you can have spreadable skeletal rigged animations without the need for FBX4V. {{< user "matka" >}} was nagging me with it for a while now and finally managed to find some time for it. Get mp.dx with vpm from https://vvvvpm.github.io/#mp.dx and overwrite all packs (especially mp.essentials and mp.fxh)
