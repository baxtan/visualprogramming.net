just when you thought it couldn't get any better...

helo everyone again to the annual look back at the numbers, vvvv and you, ja, basically the two of you, produced with each other, together, this just passed year of 2000 and 16 since they started counting. if you're new to this and want to get yourself in the mood then don't hesitate to start reading about [the 2015 numbers](/blog/2016/vvvv-in-numbers-2015) first. then come back here. i'll wait...

# webwise
in order to get a hopefully meaningful picture of whats going on around vvvv.org we try to get numbers from different sources. one of which is the statistics we get from letting google track you around our website. 

**2012**| |**2013**| |**2014**| |**2015**| |**2016**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
germany (+)|16.99%|germany (+)|17.02%|germany (-)|13.81%|germany (+)|13.85%|germany (-)|12.35%
usa (-)|10.72%|usa (-)|9.87%|usa (+)|10.74%|usa (+)|10.90%|usa (+)|11.76%
uk (-)|6.31%|russia (+)|5.78%|russia (+)|7.39%|china (+)|5.44%|japan (+)|4.85%
russia (+)|4.98%|uk (-)|5.64%|uk (-)|5.37%|russia (-)|4.77%|russia (-)|4.67%
italy (+)|4.97%|france (+)|4.93%|japan (+)|4.85%|japan (-)|4.76%|uk (=)|4.51%
france (-)|4.92%|italy (-)|4.56%|france (-)|4.12%|uk (-)|4.51%|china (-)|4.26%


and what you cannot see here is that in the lower ranks India had +11.5% and italy +9%. otherwise we seem pretty much stable compared to last year. only china and russia lost some of their interest. and japan, boooom, again. they seem to be very activvvve [over there](https://twitter.com/vvvv_jp) indeed, 万歳! (what can possibly go wrong when you're using symbols of a language you don't understand..)

regarding the number of unique visitors i have to remind you that we had this [hacker-news incident in june](/blog/2016/vvvvhat-happened-in-june-2016) which probably contributed around 5-8 thousand visitors to that figure.. so however you want to count this:

**2010** | **2011** | **2012** | **2013**|**2014**|**2015**|**2016**
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
244.010 | 313.075 | 335.056 | 350.650 | 408.173 | 448.556 | 457.541


then again, in case you haven't noticed yet, we have this [new forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/). here is one of its statistics i found most interesting. do you see what i see? is the number of new topics per day actually growing here since the forum was inaugurated end of october? i guess we'll get a better picture of this next year.

# downloads
|**2010** | **2011** | **2012** | **2013*** | **2014*** | **2015*** | **2016***
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
releases | 4 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 1
core | 45.700 | 32.100 | 36.000 | 45.000 | 42.500 | 38.000 | 29.300
addons | 10.700 | 14.400 | 18.800 | 29.000 | 28.500 | 25.200| 19.400

*\* x86 and x64 combined*

with a record low of only 1 release this time we probably get the most accurate download/usage figures so far. there really wasn't a reason to download more than once and this is what we get. we're definitely planning for more releases this year, if only to get those numbers up again!

# flattr
okok, i'm afraid at the moment it seems this [flattr](http://flattr.com/) thing isn't really going anywhere. for over a year now the've been announcing a big rework (sounds familiar?) and it hasn't happened yet (not this part!). i wouldn't want to dismiss it yet completely, since the basic idea is still the right one but from my understanding they're developing this in a different direction. let's see... but then also you don't seem to like the idea so much to flattr some of the fellow users for them sharing a crazy contribution.. so lets make this short:

|**2014** | **2015** | **2016**
|---|---|---|
vvvv income via flattr | 74.60€ | 216.22€ | 17.66€


still thanks though everyone who did support us via this way!

# licenses
i didn't think this would be possible, but see for yourself: the overall income curve clearly went up. in a non-NODE festival year! we couldn't be more happy about this...

![](Diagrams-DirectX%20Renderer_2017.01.12-20.23.02.png) 

..if not at the same time the number of individual companies who bought licenses, went down. and with it the number of different countries licenses were bought from. so that would mean more projects were realized by less companies. 

|**2011** | **2012** | **2013** | **2014** | **2015** | **2016**
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
countries| 19 | 18 | 17 | 17 | 21 | 19
companies| 52 | 61 | 69 | 81 | 102 | 90


hmm.. 

then let's have a look at the country statistics: germany's industry is still going strong. the uk it seems will have to proof itself in the next years, but look who made a jump to rank 3! what a surprise, it seems the vvvvorld operates outside of all economical assumptions.

**2012**| |**2013**| |**2014**| |**2015**| |**2016**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
germany|65%|germany|55%|germany|48%|germany|55%|germany|68%
uk|10%|uk|25%|uk|14%|uk|15%|uk|13.6%
switzerland|8%|austria|3%|switzerland|6%|switzerland|6%|russia|5.3%
russia|5%|japan|2.8%|japan|5.6%|us|3.52%|austria|3.8%
austria|3%|russia|2.5%|aut, aus, usa|4.22%|austria|3.22%|switzerland|1.5%
spain|2%|france|2.5%|russia, norway, czech|2.8%|russia|2.93%|France|1.6%


runners up are: usa and japan

so wellwellwell or should i say vlvlvl (you wouldn't hear the difference...), what do we make of all this?. vl what we've also learned this year is that numbers apparently have their own life and don't want to be interpreted too closely. so post-truth or postfaktisch as we say more poetically in the german speaking landscape, what it feels like on our side:

the release of beta35 took us about one year longer than we initially anticipated after node15. we made a few mistakes in planning our work combined with some more research necessary to get the fundamentals of thefutureofvisualprogramming (aka vl) right. with having beta35+vl finally out, we feel great relieve. both because we're now in a better position again to release more frequent updates and because using vl finally feels quite right and we're enthusiastically starting with the next steps (to be announced..). 

again your input as users and contributors has been invaluable. the quality of the contributions we saw coming in over the [past months](/blog/2017/vvvvhat-happened-in-december-2016) was very uplifting. and don't forget this is a [year of the NODE](https://nodeforum.org/announcements/node17/)! we're working hard to get everyone to frankfurt this summer to learn from each other how to best make use of all that new stuff. don't forget to [propose/request your workshops!](/blog/2016/node17-call-for-workshops)

so thanks a thousand everyone. keep miss/using vvvv, do yourself a favor and try vl and keep buying your licenses as you did last year. with that simple formula everything will be fine!

all the bests for your 2017!
yours,
vvvv
