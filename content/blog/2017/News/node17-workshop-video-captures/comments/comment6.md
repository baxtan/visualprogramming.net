an idea: if anyone is up to annotating a video like i did for the [keynode17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKHbEWaHjcw&t) video, ie. taking down time-code and a one-liner for different sections of the video in the form of e.g.:
 0:05:10 - Whatever happens at this time in the video
that would help others who watch it to get a better overview and navigation possibilities...let us know and we can add them anytime..

@veevee: for vl we preferred not to have 3-hour sessions online but rather take the time and record more suitable shorter videos...still to come..
