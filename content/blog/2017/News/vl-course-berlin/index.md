Hey all! 

Dominik here, vvvv Academy.

As promised in the vvvv Keynode in Frankfurt, besides the [Summer Course for vvvv beginners](http://vvvv.academy), we are happy to do a VL introduction course for vvvv users in Berlin this summer. 

The [vvvv Academy website ](http://vvvv.academy)only shows the vvvv Course, as it's intended for beginners and people who are not familiar with the software or community.

If you are interested, let's get together a group, find dates, and meet once or twice a week for a introduction to VL! We can start with the basics and go into advanced topics as we see fit.

If you haven't seen the vvvv Keynode in Frankfurt, here's the part where I talk about vvvv Academy:

Get in touch at NODE or at hello@vvvv.academy if you're interested!
