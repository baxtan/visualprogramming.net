You asked for it. And we have heard you. 

So we captured the last VVVVORKSHOP about VL hosted by Tonfilm and Elias and you can watch the Youtube-playlist here:

<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG540xv6kfGFIXYVV_hmOZ4U0lGgDuA11>

Tonfilm and Elias talked about VL in general and its advantages and guided step by step through a handfull of examples including topics like Loops in VL, Autonomous and Interactive Agents, Connect All, Delegates, VAudio in VL and a lot more.

And we've opened this forum thread for any VVVVORKSHOP II - Video Documentation related questions:

Happy binge watching!

Yours truly,
