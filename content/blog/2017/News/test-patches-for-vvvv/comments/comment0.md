This sounds super useful! Not as in use-it-now-for-instant-gratification, but much more long term.

I usually just visually check a bunch of patches, when I update e.g. Message internals, just to make sure all plugins still behave the way intended.

But the bare c# stuff, that gets tested automatically with every compile, both local and in the cloud. It sounds silly, but doing the effort of unit testing replaces the timid stress of reshaping core code with relieved boredom. 

I had a look into the page you linked, but could not find the testing rig itself. Did you share it somewhere else? Many packs could increase quality with a test bed like that, even if it were a local-only thing for now.
