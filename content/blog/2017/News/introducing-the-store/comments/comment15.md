already in the making, I just need to make it so vpm links can pass arguments to vpm too, that way vvvv could shellexecute only the vpm urls so user doesn't need to input where vpm is. without that it will only work with default registered vvvv and not the one which is running.  

@tonfilm: I've exploited the # notation at the end of url so now it can work with vvvvanilla HTMLTexture. Where should I push it? it's a single .v4p patch file (currently called "VPDB (VVVV VPM).v4p" but that's not too catchy)
