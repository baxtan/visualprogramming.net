@u7angel: vpm is already as simple to use as a rock with custom url's from the browser (vpm(s)://) and vpack file association. the fact that it's a command line application just makes it visible what's going on. also I chose command line because I wanted to make it easily shellexecutable if someone needs to automate vpm related tasks. also it already has a GUI for license agreement/management stuff. what else you need a GUI for in a package manager?
