HI Joreg , I love that you guys put this initiative in action. 

I also see the need of a demand page where one or various companies could ask for a certain development plug, shader .. and one or various coders could offer their skill to do it, and one or various companies could share this payment to pay the coder. 

Something like what happened with {{< contribution "vvvv.openvr" >}} 

kind regards.
