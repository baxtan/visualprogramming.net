and related self-promo here: now vpm is not only able to display a full fledged HTML page from internet with CEF where you can also include a "buy" button (to mention just one possibility) but that page now can talk to vpm as well via javascript, so the installation script is able to branch out based on user actions on the licensing page, or the licensing page can disable/enable the agree checkbox.
demonstration and new version coming soon ;)

@readme: as I understood devvvv's don't want to be involved in any monetary business between user and the pack developer they've just created this store-front. packs intentionally published as free will continue to be free

btw result of today night's development inspired by this article:
{{< youtube "BO8V68m4ebw" >}}
vpm can talk to the license pages, and a practical example what it might be used for ;)
