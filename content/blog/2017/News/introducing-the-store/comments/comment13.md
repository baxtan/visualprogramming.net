yeah unfortunately CEF is ~100 mb but reason I still use it because the built-in WebBrowser control is using an old version of internet explorer the type which has a blocking error message for every javascript error and it has that a lot because of being an old version. I will try different engines and see if they're smaller + support javascript interop later.
