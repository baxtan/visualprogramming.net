Ok, i really appreciate the effort, i was screaming for some store page since i began to use unity, but i feel like you guys are omitting completely huge part of your user base in development, in page structure, in philosophy and business model. 

I totally understand where VVVV comes from, what were the motivations behind its development and what are you trying to do with VL, I cant help but fear for the future of vvvv, despite its ever so slowly rising sales figures and your dedication and constant development.

to cut things in the shortest way possible, and what I think you guys are really missing:

Make PAID version of vvvv, with possibility of subscription model, with polished cutting edge graphics system like emeshe, with physics system that works, and other BASIC functions in current world of game engines (particle systems, spacial sound, etc). Work with contributors to make one version of vvvv that will have **great documentation** and calls in A LOT of VJs, and small one man developers that can focus on creating content with VVVV, not on making tech and then making some job with it.

There are a lot of these pieces in contributions, but look for them, and combine these different systems from different creators is often massive pain, that is why I think you need to bring these contributors in, and combine their systems into one polished thing. You get much better cash flow from something like that. People are subbing to neflixes, lyndas, audibles, adobes and other stuff nowadays, why not vvvvs? 

Now you may argue that this may be possible when you will get VL to the very functioning state, which is fair, but I never saw any signs that you are looking at smaller users. I was able to get few licenses of vvvv because i worked for larger company, I did some installations, and always used just vvvv with dx11 and kinect stuff. You need to combine some web interface with proximity sensors etc. I go for vvvv+kinect+chromium plugin. 
But now I dont do so much stuff for that company anymore, its often a bit hard to convince clients to go to experimental stuff honestly and 90% of vvvv for me is now emeshe. I use it for vjing and honestly i would not touch vvvv anymore if there was not emeshe, i would go for unity just because it allows me to go for content creation, it has big user base so there is always some help to get on the web.

You might argue that vvvv was never meant to fulfill function like this and for these uses I can just go directly to unity, but vvvv has so much untapped potential, economic and creative. Like why is DX11 still as alpha nodes in contributions? Why something so essential is not in core release, while VL now is, when arguably DX11 have much greater use than current state of VL. If i did something professional with vvvv now there is no way i would want to have VL cluttering the installations when deploying it. 

If you will bring a lot of smaller creators in, and give them great tools you boost your forum so people will get more support between them, community will be more alive, and you will get steadier cash flow from subbers that will allow you to expand the team and specialize it in different branches to stuff like physics, engine, etc.. Contributors can set much lower prices for contribs because a lot of people will be around that will drop money on them, but YOU need to kick-start community like this with very functional base product for people.

Relying so heavily on contributions for your software when you mostly cater to bigger companies and huge jobs with your business models, is kinda nonsensical.

If people as me now what software to use i usually send them to unity, vvvv is great for some stuff but there is almost nothing now that unity cant do better, only thing that is left is real time coding. Vvvv has such MASSIVE steep learning curve that its mind boggling, you need to spend so much time to be able to get some great results out, for example stuff like renderer NRT which if combined with emeshe give very decent rendering engine for animations. Tons of stuff that is hard even to find in contributions. 
That part is mind baffling to me, I have to hunt essential things through search bar
If new user comes to vvvv, he has to jump so many hoops to get to some solid level. For example if I did not went to node festival, i cant imagine where i would be now, it was massive knowledge boost and i think its almost mandatory if you want to do something professional with vvvv.

SO it just feels like you guys are catering mostly to big screen installations and you want to leave smaller graphical styles to unity and other companies, but I personally think if you really want to expand your team, the software and get exponential rise of community, you need to start looking into how make vvvv great from smaller single person user, that does just vjings and other stuff.

The direction vvvv is going now feels almost alien, a lot of contributors that I talked with about this are kinda fed up or impartial with the current system, but nobody likes it, nobody is looking forward to VL, and I just feel that vvvv is stagnating because of my type of usage. I know it is all easy said, etc. but this is just how I feel, right now I am using vvvv for maybe 7 years and it built everything I am today - professionally and artistically. I never studied math, I studied conceptual art but that why vvvv empowered me in the beginnings, and now is translating into more of a thing that is hard to shake off and slows me down, I need advanced features that are implemented in stuff like unity, but i want the philosophy and usage of vvvv, i am willing to pay for it monthly but i cant drop massive sum in one go.

So please guys at least try to look into this direction, try to think how to push vvvv as polished product for avarage joes vjs, how to push at least in some angles into feature as game engines has. Make some solid roadmap of how to grow vvvv, as product, as community, how it should make sense for big players with huge installations, and single working units like me. And I want to see you grow as a company, I want to see your own graphics department, support staff, just ways how to get bigger and better.

I am absolutely looking for node this year, last node was biggest knowledge bump of my life and the community is just so great, cant wait to see how you screw up some exotic language tshirt this time around! <3 keep it up
