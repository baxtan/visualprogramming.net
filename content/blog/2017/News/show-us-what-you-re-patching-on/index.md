Ever found yourself in the situation that you stumble upon some of your old patches and remember what crazy things you've been working on..but just never finished? And nobody ever saw it? The new **[*wip* forum category](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/wip)** is all about those unfinished, works in progress.

So far, wip-teasers have often landed among the [screenshots of the day](/blog/26) where they are soon fading into history, so here is an attempt to put a bit of a spotlight on all those hidden treasures which could be anything like:

- just a doodle that looks freaky
- a sketch from a top-secret personal or commercial project
- research into a specific topic
- first attempts on a set of nodes for vvvv or vl

## Call To Action
Whenever you're working on such a thing now, consider (not too long really, just do it!) starting a thread in the new , add a few words, thoughts where this could or should go, add an image or even an [animated gif](/blog/2016/introducing-the-rekorder) without the need to release the actual thing. Still bonus points for git(hub) links of course...

Then simply update the thread as you go along instead of starting multiple threads on the same wip. And maybe, if you get enough encouraging comments by fellow patchers this could be motivating to put some more time into it. Or maybe you're looking for collaborators and such a thread could help you find them.

## And Please
Don't use the terms "vvvv" or "vl" in a threads topic, simply use the tags **vvvv** or **vl** (or both if applicable) to allow everyone to filter the category by those.

Happy Patching!
