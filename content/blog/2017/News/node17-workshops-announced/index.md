Dear nodes,

this is it! Below you find the list of workshops you'll be able to attend during NODE17. Not all, obviously, because 7 of those are typically running in parallel but still noone should get bored. Thanks everyone for their great proposals! We tried to realize as many workshops as we possibly can but i hope everyone understands that we do have limitations of different kinds that didn't allow us to have all of the proposed workshops. 

Good news: NODE17 will offer a format (called "unconference") where any participant can host ad-hoc talks/demos/workshops in the lunch and evening breaks. So if your workshop was not chosen but you're coming to node anyway, you'll still have the chance to share your skills with a bigger audience. 

For a listing of workshops in a timetable see: [NODE17 Workshop Schedule](/blog/2017/node17-workshop-schedule)
