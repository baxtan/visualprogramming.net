dear visitors of NODE17,

we've finally opened workshop-booking for you! cheesus, sorry for the delay but you know how it goes, sometimes things go unexpected ways...

anyway now here you go:

if you've already bought a ticket you got an email with instructions already. here is just to back up:

you have two ways to browse the schedule, both show the same info, choose whichever way you prefer:
* [Timetable on NODE website](https://17.nodeforum.org/timetable) -> here you can directly book a ticket
* [Full Timetable in one image/pdf](/blog/2017/node17-workshop-schedule)

and here are two ways to get an overview of all workshops. again, same info, just different views:
* [Listing by Degree of Difficulty on NODE website](https://17.nodeforum.org/projects/creative-coding-education)-> here you can directly book a ticket
* [Listing by Categories](/blog/2017/node17-workshops-announced)

in case you encounter any problems while booking please contact the team via ping@node-forum.org

next stop: see you there!
