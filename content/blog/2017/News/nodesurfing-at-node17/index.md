woohoow, how quad is that?

the [HOPE Lab](https://nodeforum.org/journal-entries/hope-lab/) came up with this thing called **NODESurfing**: frankfurt locals are asked to share their couch with a node-visitor in exchange for an event-ticket.

Artists, designers and developers are traveling from all over the world to #NODE17 and are looking for a place to stay. Since Frankfurt is quite expensive, NODE17 offers a hosting program similar to “CouchSurfing”. Hosts that offer one or more sleeping opportunities will not only get free entry to the festival, but also the chance to get in touch with the vibrant, international festival community through the guest.{{< /box >}}
