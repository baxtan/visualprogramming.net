*FRAMED exhibition at NODE15*

Remember the FRAMED?

Those fancy screens we had exhibited at NODE15 where everyone could show their own artworks? They'll be back for NODE17 and just [as last time](/blog/2015/node15-x-framed-call-for-submissions) we're hereby calling for your submissions!

Don't remember? Here is their [official website](https://frm.fm/).

If you're a visual artist, looking for a way to get your patches out into the world, FRAMED offers a great platform for you. The device is an all-in-one flat-screen computer that runs windows and as such allows you to run vvvv/vl works. You can upload your patches to their gallery, set a price and have people from all over the world buy them for display on their personal devices.

As an inspiration here is a list of artworks that your fellow patchers have made with vvvv and are available on the framed store at the moment:

From today you can upload your artworks in either 
* **vvvv50_beta35.5_x86 + Addonpack + DX11 Pack 1.0.1** 
* **vvvv.js** 
format and everyone will be able to view them during node. We've created a {{< contribution "framed-template" "template for vvvv50" >}} that provides a simple setup to start from. For vvvv.js you simply provide a URL using the feed feature on the FRAMED website.
