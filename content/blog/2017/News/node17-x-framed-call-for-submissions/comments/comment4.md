@gaba_03 â€“ Completely up to you re publishing. We won't be making them live, eg for sale anyhow, its only for display at NODE17. Once the NODE is over, we'll get in touch with everyone that submitted and offer own accounts to upload pieces for sale if they wish. @gaba_03, you /*Pac? If so, the pieces work flawlessly! :)
