*Voil√† - the NODE17 workshop schedule.*
*(Click to enlarge or download below)*

Please Excuse,

the late delivery but here you go: The schedule of workshops for this years NODE is finally done. Last time I counted we had 49 workshops hosted by 67 of you in 5 days. And we couldn't have realized this if we hadn't had massive support by you, the hosts, some of whom offered to pay their own travels and some helping out with hardware-sponsoring. It is an honour to be embedded in such a supportive community where we see that people on all ends are working together to make NODE17 a great time for everyone. 

Now the challenge is on you to pick your workshops for the week. Without claim of completeness here are some suggested routes you could take:

### The vvvv Beginner
If you're basically new to vvvv you best choose one of the 3 beginner workshops that start on monday. Two of them (german and english) go for 2 days straight, whereas the **vvvv for Programmers** takes a bit faster route and only goes on monday. Then you'd go to **3D Basics & Building Interaction** on wednesday, take the **Transformations** or **DX11 Introduction** on thursday and finish off the week on saturday with either fullday **Cutting and Folding Paper** or first choose between **VideoFX & Compositing** and **vvvv.js** and then have some **Projection Mapping**. 

### The Casual Patcher
Assuming you're already familiar with vvvv and don't need a beginners treatment anymore then you'd start monday with the **Box 2D** workshop. Tuesday you choose between **DX11 Shaders Upper-Intermediate**, **VAudio**, **Bullet Physics** and **Structured Programs**. Wednesday is planned for you to invest more time in one particular topic. Choose any of the full-day workshops that sounds most appealing to you. Thursday I'd suggest **VVVV-Message**, **Triangle, TetGen, Dope**, **DX11 Rendering** or the **OpenVR Introduction**. And saturday just don't miss **AutomataUI** and that should do.

### The VL Futurist
If you're mostly interested in the future of visual programming we've spread out vl workshops all over the week for you. Take the **VL for vvvv users** introduction on either monday or thursday, dig deeper with **VL Concepts and Patterns** I and/or II on monday and/or thursday, learn how to **develop nodes for VL** on tuesday and realize a whole **VL Project** on wednesday. That should really get you started. 

### The Graphic Aficionado
If you're coming to learn all about dx11 your route is easy. Have a look at the MARGARET column where you see you can basically camp in that room. Only on tuesday you have an overlap with the **Upper-Intermediate** shader workshop and on thursday you have an overlap with the **Forward+** workshop. Other than those two slots you should not need to worry about missing anything.

### The Maker
The path for makers and tinkerers starts on tuesday with **Internet Of Things** followed by **Silly Machines**, goes on wednesday with **DMX Programming**, thursday with **Why Firmata?** and climaxes saturday with either or a full day of **Cutting and Folding Paper**, **3d Printing Introduction**, **3d Printing Ceramics** and **3d Printing Instance Noodles** or **Hacking Sex**.
