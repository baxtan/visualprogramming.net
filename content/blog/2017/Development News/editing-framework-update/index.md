Pointmovers of vvvv!

The [Editors](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/topics/graphics/direct3d-9/basics/editing-framework/editing-framework.html) got some new features.

**Stepping through the points via Keyboard**
* **Q** - next point
* **Shift+Q** - previous one
* **Space** - select point
* **W** - switch between Controls of a Knot (in a Bezier Editor).

**Marquee selection in a Bezier Editor**
* If Points are getting selected, Controls are ignored.
* Press **F** - to Force selection, it allows to mix the selection of Points and Controls.

**Support for DX11**
The Editors by itself are graphics-engine-independent, but their points, lines and handles must be rendered. From now on there are DX11 Views for every Editor.

**The Editors:**
