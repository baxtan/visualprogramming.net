just had a go with it, and it looks amazingly useful. I want to pre-define a camera path in-scene.

Unfortunately it becomes close to unusable, if your spline is not within a small range.

if you try this in the dx11 BezierEditorView help patch, and scroll out a little, you will see that marking points is still ok, but moving them is hardly possible at all.

changing pick size does not improve the situation. manually changing Axis size could help, but really doesn't
