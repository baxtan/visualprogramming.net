Dear pointmovers,

from now on you can translate, rotate and scale way more faster.
There is a Gizmo for that. 
And every Editor in our [EditingFramework](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/topics/graphics/direct3d-9/basics/editing-framework/editing-framework.html) has it inside.

* Press 'g' to turn a Gizmo On/Off
* Pick and drag its handles to transform the points 
* Hold 'Shift' for uniform scaling
* Nudge points with arrow keys

The Gizmo is working in both DX9 and DX11 worlds.
See Editor's helppatches.

Nothing more to say.
Easy.
