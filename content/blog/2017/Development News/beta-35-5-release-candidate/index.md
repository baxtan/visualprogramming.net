As you may have noticed, we are back in our every 2 month release cycle and a new beta is up on the horizon.

As we have noticed, not many of you use alpha builds to test it against your latest an greatest projects. So here is a particular fine alpha version that is our release candidate for beta35.5 scheduled for Monday.

Please give it a test run with a few patches and send us reports on any bug or problem you encounter. Testing is also the perfect excuse to miss any Easter obligation.

### New VL nodes
Also try out some new goodies that you can find here:
[XML and JSON](/blog/2017/vl-xml-and-json-nodes)
[Event based MIDI](/blog/2017/vl-event-based-midi)
[Reactive Programming](/blog/2017/vl-reactive-programming)
And even more: [Change Log](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/index.html)

### Temp file issue
Some have reported that they are seeing ~temp files being written on save. We could not reproduce the error here, but we have now an error pop-up to inform you when something goes wrong and the exception that caused the problem will be copied into the clipboard. Open the projects that have that issue and paste the exception message into a [new forum thread](https://discourse.vvvv.org/) to help us tracking it down.
