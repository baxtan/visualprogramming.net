it's made in C# you develop for it in C# and then if you don't want to spend too much time in visual studio for some reason it's just a matter of taste what scripting language you implement through the library importer (like IronPython, CSX or Edge.js).
Vulkan or DX12 is a harder nut but both have C# bindings. I vote for keeping it as low level and as close to the actual library as possible. Also I'm against built in editors, atom.io, sublime text or visual studio will always do a way better job. So I'm rather voting for listening to file changes rather than reinventing the wheel.
