thanks velcrome!
it is the hidden "Formular" pin that is not used at all, which comes with the problems.
it gets created but not used. no enum type assigned... sooo. either you set a proper enum type, or you just delete the pin or argue that it is us to blame.
for the latter strategy i am now again considering it no programmers fault of creating an enum without assigning an enum type.

thanks for the report
