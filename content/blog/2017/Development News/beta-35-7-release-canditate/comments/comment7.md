Thanks @gregsn, adding an arbitrary EnumName in the pin's attribute fixed it.

If you actually consider this a mistake on the plugininterface's user side (fair enough), then please also escalate an error message if you detect a missing EnumName.

Something you might like to hear: The alpha thingy I tried to show you the other night (with the enum ioboxes displaying wrong data) seems to have vanished. 

So from my perspective, there is only the problem with enums flashing red (especially in inspector) for one frame. Don't know if this will cause issues, but my packs seem alright (but then again, I regularily check against null and nil for most pins).
