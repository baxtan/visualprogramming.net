now that C# 7.0 came out a couple of months ago and 7.2 is in the making ;P which also has couple of useful features like the tuple syntax (ValueTuple), deconstructing variable declaration, out variables, expression bodies everywhere, the pattern matching `is` or `switch` etc etc

also how about using Roslyn for the dynamic plugin backend and for the editor intellisense? or even better a node factory for csx files? ;)
