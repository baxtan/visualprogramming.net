- This workshop is focused on the development of parametric-generative design tools inspired by architecture and product design techniques and how to fabricate three dimensional modular pieces.
- It is suitable for anyone interested in geometric patterns, packaging, architecture, product design, scenography, 3D mapping.

##  Software we use:
- vvvv: [/](https://vvvv.org/404)
#  Packs:
- DX11 {{< contribution "directx11-nodes" >}}
- Instanced Noodles {{< contribution "instance-noodles" >}}  
- ParaLib {{< contribution "paralib" >}}

##  Requirements
-VVVV is windows only.
-Mac Possible with bootcamp,
[best practices when using bootcamp](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/devvvveloping/userpages/best-practices-with-bootcamp.html)
-Some vvvv skills are welcome, but it would be possible to get results without any programming knowledge.
-Vector graphics software capable to load svg files. (Preferable Adobe Illustrator)

##  Program:
#  Day 1 and 2:
- Introduction to “Parametric design with cardboard, concepts & inspiration”
- Parametric Library overview. 
- Introducing the datatypes: polyline, polygon, surface, box.
- Object modelling using diverse techniques:
- Creating object arrays,
- Surface modelling based on B-Splines,
- 2D Patterns,
- Surface Panelization, 
- Polygon Extrusion, 
- Surface & Polygon Triangulation...

#  Day3:
- OBJ export, to be used on other software.
- 3D objects unfold.
- SVG blueprints export, cutting sheets preparation.
- Cardboard models cutting and mounting.
