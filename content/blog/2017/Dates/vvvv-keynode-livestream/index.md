Thanks everyone who was there and followed us live.
It was a great evening with you and we are very happy about all the super positive feedback we got for the speakers and the show.

Also big, big thanks to the technical team around @MSBERGER from [Satis&Fy](https://vvvv.org/businesses/satisfy-ag-deutschland) who made this show look so pro in the stream. As well as the team around @eno from [NSYNK](https://vvvv.org/businesses/nsynk-gesellschaft-f%C3%BCr-kunst-und-technik) for the stage video production using their vvvv based tool IRIS.


Enjoy the rest of NODE17!
