Hello everyone!

here it is, the second edition of vvvv Academy!

{{< youtube "tVy1y66iNMI" >}}

Here's all the info: <http://vvvv.academy/winter-course.html>

It will be more compact than the Summer Course - 6 full days, with lectures and patching sessions. Starting January 3rd.

We will once again be in the vvvv developer's office in Berlin - where else would you want to learn vvvv?

Also, we'll have less people - a group of 6 this time, so we can have an even more focused learning environment.

Get in touch via
hello@vvvv.academy

Best from the rainy UK
Dominik
