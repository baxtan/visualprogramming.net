Hello again,

Our vvvvorkshop series will continue.
This second session will be aimed at beginners - in [VL](/blog/blog/devvvvlopment-update-january-2017).
Yes, you read it right, this time we will dive into the next level of visual programming. {{< user "Tonfilm" >}} and {{< user "Elias" >}} are so kind to guide us through all kinds of object oriented spreading strategies and will teach us new ways of solving common patching problems.


What do you need to bring?

* Windows laptop running vvvv
* Please Install the latest version of [vvvv and the AddonPack](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads).
* If you encounter any problems installing vvvv please contact us before the workshop
* ( It’s fine to share a machine with two people, this is a good way to learn. )
* 3 Button Mouse
There will be a fee of 20,00 € per attendee to pay for the room, we are booking for this workshop.
If you consider yourself a professional patcher or your company sends you here to become one, we use T.R.U.S.T here to encourage you to ask for a professional fee which is 200,00 €. 

**DATE**	11.02.2017
