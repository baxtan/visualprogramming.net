WORKSHOP INFO
The workshop provides the tools to build a project based on the use of real-time multimedia (digital sets, audio-visual performances, interactive installations, etc.). The following topics will be tackled: problems and phases in the construction of a process, from production to staging, in order to realize one’s artistic work. The workshop explores in terms of both theoretical and practical points of view, the aspects that make up a show of contemporary dance or an multimedia installation. It aims to further understanding of the differences in the creation of these two art forms, namely the manner and timing by which the elements are used and combined: body, sound and image.
