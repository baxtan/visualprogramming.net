Wisp Laboratory is an intense week of setting up a 3D Audio & 360° Video system together with participants in Kontor 80, Leipzig.
We are experimenting with a 3D audio and 360° video setup and the Lab resumes in final performances and concerts on Sunday 23rd of July, where different shows and projects are presented in a public event.
