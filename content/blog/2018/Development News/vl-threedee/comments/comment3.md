This is really impressive! It looks alot like unity and from my experience with unity the core advantage to me are having Scene, Material, Animation and Sound Editors that can be used the import and Edit assets.

Both options for implementations sound valid. In the Video it appears you create a Scene in the Engines Editor -> Define References for VL within the editor for VL ( Sphere ) -> Have an Application (exe) with separate VL Editor that can still be edited.

In this Demo you can create and Edit all the Scene Objects within the Editor ( Import, Position, Animation, Sound, Shader selection, Material editing ) 
Does this mean that all Shaders, Html-Texture other Plugins would need to be developed for Xenko? Could VL also be the Source for Textures etc?
This sounds like VL would become something like Bolt Visual-Scripting for Unity but with a lot more features it can access outside of the engines features.  ( [](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/bolt-87491) ) 


Would an implementation like Skia ( VL Including Xenko the Rendering Engine ) make it harder to deploy Multiplatform applications from it?  Could this still allow opening "Scenefiles" from the Xenko Editor? Then both Options have the same benefit of Asset Management.

I really like the idea of having something like an editor for Asset management.
The only thing i find **really important** is that VL + Xenko would still allow the experimental workflows VVVV allows its users. Full Editors tend to influence the work created and less "happy mistakes" happen.
