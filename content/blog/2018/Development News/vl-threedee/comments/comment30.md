After some convincing by the devs at LINK, I came to the conclusion that Xenko really **can** be the thing that VL needs, shortcutting the work on a render pipeline by months (if not years). There seem to be a lot of symbiotic potential between the two.

Also, from todays standpoint, Xenko does seem quite complete for a rendering engine (few things are missing, ofc, such as advanced gpu buffers or animation timelines), and accessibility of the xenko properties (such as scene graph, or materials) is very clean.

Its worthwile to say there are still a few things that are not perfect (i.e. it uses its very own xksl, which seems mighty, but then again, unity shader did seem mighty at one point too). Also, the community seems quite small as of now, so progress within xenko is likely, but far from certain. 

But again, devs made a reasonable risk assessment, that I can follow without stomach ache.
