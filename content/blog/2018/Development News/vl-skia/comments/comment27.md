Hi {{< user "yar" >}}, what do you mean by "I can't group paths and sample them"?
Have you tried to use Path Operations (Skia calls it "Op") and then sample the resulting path?
Just like that:

There is also a helppatch about it. 
Please open the HelpBrowser (F1) and navigate to **4_Path/03_Path-Operations**.

Is it something you are looking for?


Best,
Anton
