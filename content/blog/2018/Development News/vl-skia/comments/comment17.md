Hi, I went through all the examples and it is quite impressive already, buttery smooth and a life-saver when round corners or animated dashed outlines are required. PDF output will be great for any print requirements as well.

As for the interaction bit, are you planning to include TouchDevice input for multitouch UIs as well?

I've managed to get VL.Skia drawing according to touch inputs by wrapping its IImage output in a DX11 renderer and then feeding back the touch data from that window but that feels slightly bloated and requires the inclusion of VVVV.

I checked the Console node but even the generic Notification output does not output any Touch specific data.
