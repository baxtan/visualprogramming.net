{{< user "@joreg" >}}, I want to try something with lasers and search a way to generate points - from svg or with manipulation on shapes. For now I dig Skia and understand, that it's not very convenient but promissing. If Skia would can interpret layers into points with resampling, simplification and bin-groups â€” it will be great. But I think it would be more great if EtherDream has a vl version supported by Skia.

I also looked towards Lottie, animated svg, which can be exported from AfterEffects. It would be very cool to work with them from VVVV.
