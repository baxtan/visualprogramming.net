{{< user "joreg" >}}, I can only sample SKPath, It not possible to convert layer in understandable vectors or sampled points, with color. And I can't group paths and sample them. At least I did not found how. If talk about Lottie it would be great to draw in AE for the laser or for UI.

upd: I mentioned about inconvenience only in laser context. Skia super great thing, I love it as much as I love draw vector graphics.
