Suggestions to improve the article as those parts were unclear to me:

> For information on how to use NuGets with VL, see Managing NuGets in the VL documentation. 

A link to the respective paragraph in the documentation would be helpful.

> In short, navigate via document menu to Dependencies -> Manage NuGets -> Commandline and then type:

Specify what document menu this is referring to. I initially couldn't figure it out (vvvv, some other development environment, ...). After looking around for a bit I figured it's the document menu of VL.

> Drag & drop an example patch onto vvvv

This doesn't work for me. vvvv only creates an IOBox with the path to the example. UPDATE: This works with the latest version of vvvv beta37.
