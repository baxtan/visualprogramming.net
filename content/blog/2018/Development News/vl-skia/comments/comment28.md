Hi, {{< user "robotanton" >}}. Thanks! This is a great example. Is it possible to sample this path not uniformly? Circle with step, but star part only as points of which it composed. And what about different objects (which combined without crossing)? Probably, I want to get Bezier points. But maybe the curves (not straight) I would like to get automatically sampled. But if you sample such a path as in an example, then we get points all the way.
