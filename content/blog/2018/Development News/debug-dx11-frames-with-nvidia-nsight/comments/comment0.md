oh nice! same goes for renderdoc. And I also like to point out dotTrace and dotMemory by Jetbrains. with dotMemory you can have a look which object takes up how much space in ram. We're currently using that to hunt down a memoryleak. And with dotTrace you can have a look at how long methods are executing and a timeline about what each thread created from vvvv are doing ;)
unfortunately though they're not free
