Holy patchers!

To answer the often contemplated question of "Where the hell is this all going?" we first have to establish that vvvv is different things for different people. Let's have a look at some of these different perspectives:

- vvvv - a generative designers best friend
- vvvv - a data visualizers wonder weapon
- vvvv - an interaction designer's magic wand
- vvvv - the multiscreen solution
- vvvv - physical computing covered
- vvvv - a projectionmapper's dream
- vvvv - rapid prototyping on steroids
- vvvv - your procedural lighting desk
- vvvv - computervision for everyone
- vvvv - stage? show? control!
- vvvv - fish feeding for the lazy
- vvvv - L.A.S.E.R zzzz!1!!

That's all?, we hear you say...and you mumble on, but can I please has:

- vvvv - a tool for machines to learn
- vvvv - easy logic for gamers
- vvvv - visual scripting done right
- vvvv - klickklickklick your mobile app
- vvvv - the no-brainer IOT toolbox
- vvvv - the final webdev solution
- vvvv - an admin's batching buddy
- vvvv - robots dig this
- vvvv - no controller too micro
- vvvv - from sound to noise in one patch
- vvvv - any shaders of gray
- vvvv - scratch that: kids taken seriously

Well, vl, vl, we hear ya.. and that's exactly why at the heart of it all, we have always been, and will continue to work on:
- vvvv - a multipurpose toolkit

## Introducing vvvv gamma

When we started working on VL, we never thought about creating anything different than vvvv. We had our issues with vvvv and wanted to solve those. But mostly we loved it and wanted to keep the good things we still enjoy about it. Essentially we set out to rewrite vvvv to make it better, nothing more.

So it is our great pleasure that we can finally annouce the impending release of what we've so far been referring to as "VL standalone":

![](gamma6.png)

For a start, vvvv gamma will focus on 3 main scenarios: 
* 2d interactive motion graphics using VL.Skia
* computervision using VL.OpenCV
* controlling devices, ie. everything IO (Midi, UDP, OSC, RCP, HTTP...)

Frankly it will be gorgeous and above all shine through the following features:
<!--{SPLIT()}-->
* a smooth, dark and gray userinterface
* tons of examples and thorough documentation
* [object oriented programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM)
<!--~~~-->
* multithreading
* patching with any .NET library
* windows executable export
<!--{SPLIT}-->

## So beta vs. gamma, really?

Nope, don't think *vs.*, we prefer to think â™¥!
Here is how to read this: Over the past years we've been R&D'ing a next generation visual programming language that we dubbed: VL. And we still call it that: VL is a programming language, just like c#, that now happens to power two of our products: 

* vvvv 50betaX
* vvvv gamma 2019.X

While for vvvv beta, VL is just another language it supports, for vvvv gamma, VL is the core. As such, both beta and gamma will continue to profit as we progress with VL. We are well aware of the fact that gamma is not going to replace beta for everyone anytime soon. We're therefore commited to support both equally for the foreseeable future.

If you're interested in a few more details regarding how we'll be polishing vvvv gamma for its initial release, please head over to our [roadmap](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/roadmap.html).

## What will gamma cost?

We're still working this out and will update you on licensing early next year.

## Wait and what about Xenko/3d?

As we've previously [reported from our lab](/blog/2018/vl-xenko-3d-engine-update-2), our initial efforts of integrating the Xenko 3d engine couldn't have gone much smoother. We have helped realize a [complex multiuser VR project](http://oceanofair.com/) within just 4 months besides our research and now know that this is certainly the way for us to go forward. VL.Xenko will complete vvvv gamma to a fancypantsy interactive 3d authoring environment. 

We're confident to be releasing an initial public version of VL.Xenko before 2019.Q4 and we have some ideas for a prerelease phase that we'll announce soon.

Thanks for using vvvv, thanks for your feedback on VL, thanks for your patience, thanks for the licenses you buy which makes this journey possible for all of us. 

Have a nice holiday, get some rest, because 2019 will be the year of the vvvv desktop!

yours,
