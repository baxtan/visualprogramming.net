The nodes we created so far allow to setup the scene graph and also combine it with [scenes](https://doc.xenko.com/latest/en/manual/game-studio/scenes.html) or [prefabs](https://doc.xenko.com/latest/en/manual/game-studio/prefabs/index.html) made in xenko's game studio.{{< /box >}}
so you can build any scene with game studio and add dynamic content in vl, its the same scene graph. you can also "prepare" any content in game studio and load it dynamically as a Prefab when you need it. since you can access the whole scene graph, you can modify it as you like in vl. but there is no xenko 3d editor to vl patch conversion.
