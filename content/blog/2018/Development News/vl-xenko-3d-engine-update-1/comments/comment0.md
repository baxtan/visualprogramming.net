thanks for the update - looks exciting!
it might be too early for this question: do you have plans already how to intermingle xenkos editor and the scenegraph built up programmatically from within VL? the posted example shows the scenegraph entities created completely in the patch. if i'd like to design the scene using the xenko editor - would i automatically get this scene as a patch like above? (would this even make sense?)

i'm asking because having this capable editor from xenko would be one of the big advantages for many projects and i wonder which direction will be pursued first...
