Hello ,
I'm trying to install the library but when launch the command nuget install VL.OpenCV -prerelease ( like the Git readme) makes this error:

The process cannot access the file '\vvvv_50beta38.1_x64\lib\packs\SharpDX.Mathematics.4.0.1\lib/net45/SharpDX.Mathematics.dll' because it is being used by another process.
