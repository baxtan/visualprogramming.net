Wow, thats really awesome! Finally consistent methods of handling files and easy to find names. One thing I am never sure about and maybe should be an options for the writers, is whether or not the Writer also creates the directories or not. Can I just give it a path and it will create the folder structure if it doesn't exist or not? Would be nice to have an option for "create directories", so I can either have them be created during writing if they dont exist or if disable it throws an error like "target directory doesn't exist". What do you think? I can see both cases being handy depending on what you want to do.
