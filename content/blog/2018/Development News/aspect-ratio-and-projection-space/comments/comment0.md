@gregsn, this is very much appreciated and totally makes sense. this is one of the terrible things a vvvv noobs has to cope with. especially designer don't understand why the stage stretches with the window size.

in terms of the dx9 implementation, i'm not able to really thoroughly test it since we work with dx11 in projects and even at university.

i'm looking forward to the dx11 implementation, although the problem is not as visible in dx11 as in dx9 since vux did this aspect ratio layer node which solves 50% of the problem. the mouse/touch coordinates still need handling there.
