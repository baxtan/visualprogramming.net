@u7angel: thank you sir! 
@microdee: well, it's a hardnock life for us. but.. yeah: seriously all this effort, just to get things easy that should be easy. in my opinion positioning elements in spaces (world, view, projection) that are totally incompatible to input device spaces (pixels space or "normalized window space"), ignoring viewports, crops and aspect ratio transforms is just totally random, doesn't align and has been a major design flaw. You want to be able to compare positions (incoming from devices or outgoing for drawing).

I at least would of course like to see DX11 to follow. I am in contact with vux, who's been a bit sceptical, because of reasons, but let's just give it a shot in dx9 first and pick up the discussion later on.
