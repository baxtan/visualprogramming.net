Facebook is just another channel for keeping in touch with other vvvv guys but there's a lot of unimportant noise which would just litter this site or the riot channel. If something important arises it will end up on this site too most of the time.

I know this post is not about the technology but the interaction, the rant about the DX9 and my frustrations with it was a sidetrack.

Good to hear that efforts have been already started to make DX11 vanilla.
