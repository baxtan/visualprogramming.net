* "but on the other hand why should I care?" you don't need to actually. We made sure that DX11 patches work as they did. so no breaking change for you.
* implementing it in DX9 now lets us compare the approaches side by side.
* when there is consensus about the approach i'll be happy to be of any use on the DX11 implementation. also started that effort already.
* "Do VL". Good to hear. Yeah we do. But i will take the freedom and still work on vvvv when i feel the urge to.
* actually it's not about DX9 vs. DX11 at all. It's about a general interaction concept, not about a certain technology.
* about you guys discussing everything on facebook: sure. what could go wrong.
