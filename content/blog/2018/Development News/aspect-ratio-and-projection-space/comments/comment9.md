A very welcome change, even though as others have said, we aren't using DX9 anywhere any longer. 

@hrovac: Of course its easy to understand, but it gets so much more complicated when you want to build a somewhat responsive GUI and have to deal with lots of elements. All of a sudden you need to make everything scale and have to worry about pixel-perfect mouse input at any renderer size or shape. That's where things get hard and any help to make it more predictable and logical (ie. no distortions, because who would want anything to distort beyond what was designed) will be helpful.
