@gregsn: well now I need to use another extra node somewhere else if I want the original behavior back. but on the other hand why should I care? I haven't touched DX9 since 2013. When it's asked around on facebook I see most if not all serious vvvv users are in similar situation. Why spend time on the DX9 renderer? Leave it there as legacy. Make DX11 vanilla! Even if there's bidirectional disagreements about licensing and implementation and other stuff between vux and the devvvvs it's been 5 years since DX11 got released. Enough time imo to get onto common grounds. Unless you want to support hardware made before 2002 DX9 is pointlessly limiting and old now. It hurts vvvv's image so badly too. Whenever I want to introduce it to total stranger there's always a conversation like
- "oh yeah btw the default graphics backend is DX9 and vvvv won't even start without it"
- "uurgh, okay so there's no support for modern graphics libraries?"
- "yeah there is actually but that's a 3rd link you have to download and unzip yourself"
- "oh god but why?"
- "nobody knows exactly, something something legacy I guess"

I know VL is more important right now and that is good. Do that. But also include the DX11 in packs folder by default. I'm sick of this situation :P
