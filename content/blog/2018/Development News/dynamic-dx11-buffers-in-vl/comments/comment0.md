This is really cool and I think I will try to use it in our current project.

Found a really cool Game of Life easteregg inside, much much appreciated.

Was there a reason why you could not implement {{< node "UploadBuffer (DX11.Buffer)" >}} in vl too? I ask because I am interested in the nitty-gritty technical details, why the actual gpu upload was eventually moved out of vl to this (proprietary) vvvv plugin.

Game of Life looks great in VL after all, including easy array swapping. Much recommended reading material I'd say. 

could not resist:
