For custom types in C#, this page says that after importing the type, to "simply pass it directly to the buffer." Which version of the buffer? Spread? I have my types imported into VL but don't see a way to actually pass it into the buffer or turn my type into a spread (and wouldn't doing that force me to set the stride anyway?).
