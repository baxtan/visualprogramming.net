@velcrome yes, you discovered a bug, latest alpha doesn't jump to error if PauseOnError is off. compile splash will also be on primary screen now. we could not reproduce your third issue, make sure you don't have any args.txt besides your vvvv.exe that has /allowmultiple set.

we still have a few minor things, but new RC should be up soon. thanks a lot for testing!
