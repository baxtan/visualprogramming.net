@readme: thanks, tracked for next release
@sunep: the log says: "Addflow5.ocx not registered. Run setup.exe!" so this was the reason for vvvv not starting, not the "Win10 Fullscreen optimization". anyway i improved the error message to include the information also, so we not only have it in the log.
