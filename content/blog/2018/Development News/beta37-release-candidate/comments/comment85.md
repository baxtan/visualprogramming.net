First of all I want to say terrific blog! I had a quick question which I'd like 
to ask if you do not mind. I was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear your mind prior to writing.
I've had difficulty clearing my mind in getting my ideas out there.
I truly do take pleasure in writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 
minutes are lost just trying to figure out how to 
begin. Any suggestions or hints? Appreciate it!
