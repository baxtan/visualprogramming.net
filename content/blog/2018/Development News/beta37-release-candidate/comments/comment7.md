when starting the alpha, and doubleclicking a v4p, the v4p will not be openened with the (already open) vvvv instance, but will instead start with the registered vvvv.exe. 

makes it look like it is defaulting allowmultiple to true?

edit: my *default* installation of beta36 had an args.txt, flagging **/allowmultipe**
so the doubleclick on a v4p is directed to said default installation. this explains the unexpected behaviour
