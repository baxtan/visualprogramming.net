you mean #2? the locking thing?

calling this behaviour a "Jump To Error"-feature seems simply wrong, if a patching bug (that wasn't even there in beta36, patch is running ok there, just accepting blame preemptively here) is gravely elevated so it cannot be investigated, mitigated, or fixed. 

I am sure there must be something wrong here with the RC, no matter whats wrong with the patch itself. it should still allow me to look around my patches, no?
