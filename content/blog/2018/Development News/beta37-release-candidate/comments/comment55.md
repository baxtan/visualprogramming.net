I do this:

1. run setup.exe and install everything until everything is green
2. run vvvv.exe, I get the error message
3. I run Setup.exe again, uncheck the disable fullscreen... pin
4. quit setup.exe
5. start setup.exe
6. recheck disable fullscreenn...
7. run vvvv.exe and now it will run

EDIT: I think that is a couple of too many times to run setup.exe and know that you need to uncheck and recheck the fullscreen stuff
