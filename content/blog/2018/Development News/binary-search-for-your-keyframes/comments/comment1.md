@u7angel, I think its cool that VL can do do this without having to know C#. I'm not that keen on scripting, though you are, and more power to your elbow, but I find it easier to follow a patch and reuse either nodes or whole patterns of coding than to learn C#. It seems appropriate to show users the power of the software they've developed with practical examples, wouldn't you say? To my understanding, there shouldn't be any particular performance difference between either method.

@tonfilm, how could these nodes be used to search through 2D or 3D points?
