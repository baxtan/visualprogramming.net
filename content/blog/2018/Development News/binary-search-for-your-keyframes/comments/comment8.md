{{< box >}}quote:tonfilm:
 i strongly disagree in generalized statements like "VL just isn't good at lowlevel things like binary search. Too bad, but that seems to be the case." that's simply not true and might confuse beginners{{< /box >}}
You're right, that might be said too much.

You need to show us that, though. Everyone is looking at the patches you make to see if VL is any good!
I guess all I want to say is that this current patch gives people (me inc) reason to believe that VL is not good at lowlevel things like binary search (whether true or not).

As for me, I need to see it before I believe it!
