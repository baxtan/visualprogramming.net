hi @dominikKoller,

the messy looking part in that patch is there to catch corner cases and errors. so i disagree here, the core of the algorithm is quite beautiful in VL and proves that VL is much more than only a high level prototyping environment. if you are scared by it or you don't understand that patch, just ignore it. and i strongly disagree in generalized statements like "VL just isn't good at lowlevel things like binary search. Too bad, but that seems to be the case." that's simply not true and might confuse beginners.

however, i agree that it could be patched in a cleaner looking way by separating the parts of the algorithm into smaller operations.
