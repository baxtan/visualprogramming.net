@microdee and @u7angel we chose category over namespace mostly because its nicer for humans and we have a history with it.

namespace is a term from textual programming and has nerd factor level 9999. it's purpose is to have symbols with the same name in one context and be able to distinguish them, not to sort and browse symbols.

category is known by all vvvv users and the term can be easily understood by non-programmers. it's also more natural to explain that the node browser is ordered in categories (3D, Math, Collections etc.) than in namespaces. and programmers will get it in no time.
