@tonfilm, i can understand the intention but don't you borrow a lot of terminology from .net languages and OOP ? it feels a bit inconsistent to name the starting point differently. in vvvv it was totally ok to work with categories, since they didn't have a deeper meaning (e.g. namespace scope in OOP) 

but since VL tries to be the OOP visual language (and of course more), it confuses more than it helps to choose right here, a different naming. reading articles about OOP and having a similar use of terms, helps you to relate things you learn across languages.

remembering learning vvvv, it took really long to relate concepts to other languages. not just because vvvv is one of a kind but also the naming did not help. e.g. spreads aka arrays aka lists...
