@u7angel yes it's true that we borrow and actually implement a lot from the OOP and .NET world. here we kept the vvvv name for the reasons mentioned above. if that creates too much problems for beginners and programmers that know other languages we can change that terminology at a later point. as for all new features we observe, learn and then react if it doesn't work out as expected.
