Yes, the last gif is nice, but nothing new in vl. Even before you could set the category for individual patches (from inside, that is). 

I have been using Groups for structuring before, but never really felt comfortable with them, because it **hides** stuff (instead of only encapsulating). So eventually I tend to remove them in favour of readablility, once I seriously start to clean up.

One thing I disciplined myself to: never mix different namespaces (what you call category) into one Group, because that's a recipe for confusion. Seems to me like your solution attempts to maximize the potential for confusion ;-)

I really like the way you can now use absolute and relative category naming, the rest, unfortunately, not so much. Three different ways to save a few keystrokes while setting the category (and still not enforcing them) seems overly complex while not addressing some things that are important (at least to me, like first-glance-understanding). 

If I were to make a shared project or even a lib, I would rather use the new regions and individual category settings for each patch, than to resort to these new features. Simply because I care for the patcher that has to read my patch one day.
