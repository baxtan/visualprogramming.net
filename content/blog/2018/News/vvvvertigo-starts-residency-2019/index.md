helo patchers,

we call upon you in your role as artists! this is a bit short notice but should be an interesting opportunity for the both of us. check this:

{{< box >}}quote:vertigo:
Artists and creatives, have the chance of getting a grant of up to 30000â‚¬ to collaborate with a Tech Project and produce an original artwork based on its technology!{{< /box >}}

now consider vvvv/vl/xenko as the tech project in the above equation and if you then find it to resolve to the variable x that is you, by all means please **[apply here](https://vertigo.starts.eu/calls/starts-residencies-call-3/projects/vvvv-a-visual-programming-environment/detail/)**.

the catch: **deadline November 28th**

so short notice, and quite a bit of a process to prepare your application (sorry for that but we also only found out about this recently) but the prospect is a bright one: come join us in playing with the future of visualprogramming and bring in your artistic vvvvisions. 

but also check out all the [other projects](https://vertigo.starts.eu/projects/) and spread [this call](https://vertigo.starts.eu/calls/starts-residencies-call-3/detail/)!

good luck everyone!
