![VVVV Workshops by Creative Coding Cairo ](23434836_372953903118699_4329251771051591570_n.jpg) 

Hello from Cairo !
I am happy to announce that i had the first introductory workshop in Cairo - Egypt  at  Creative Coding Cairo .
This workshop was after i attended The VVVV Academy course last summer in Berlin . It was a great chance to share back here with Artists , Designers , Programmers and the CC Community in Cairo what they can do with VVVV  in a 3 days workshop .  I am Preparing now for another Workshop to come soon for more  and more people to practice the basics . 

I started Creative Coding Cairo to build a community for creative coders in Egypt  as a one space for Artists , Designers , Coders and Makers to meet and share knowledge .
