Dear patchers worldwide,

we're planning to take the [vvvv academy](http://vvvv.academy) on tour this summer. There will be another course in Berlin in July and we'd like to also take it to 2 more cities in europe or beyond. 

The course ideally runs like this:
• wednesday, thursday, friday plus monday, tuesday wednesday of the next week
• 2x3 hours a day
• with ~6 participants
• I'll be coming to run the course and could need a local assistent

So here is our question:
• Do you have an office space (~30sqm room with power, internet, projector) that you could offer for a week? 
• In the time between end of July to end of September?
• Can you help us activate your local community so we get ~6 people signing up for a course that will cost 800€?

What's in it for you?
• To be discussed, but for one thing you'll meet a crowd of motivated people who could potentially be interested to work with you in the future. 

Please let us know your thoughts and questions. If you're interested please get in touch via [dominik@vvvv.academy](mailto:dominik@vvvv.academy)
