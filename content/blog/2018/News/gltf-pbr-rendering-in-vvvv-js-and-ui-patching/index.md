![VVVV.js glTF implementation](glTF%20VVVVJS%20Implementation.JPG) 

In the past couple of months I implemented almost the full spec of the glTF 3d file format into VVVV.js.
It comes together with a core shader and resamples basically a ready to go rendering engine for the web.
The model pipeline from Blender / Substance Painter is super straight forward and well documented by the Khronoes Group 
Here is a video demonstration of the glTF Nodes in VVVV.js:

In addition I want to post this tutorial about UI programming with VVVV.js which I did together with another notorious vvvv patcher, Nisidis.
It approaches a couple of most-wanted questions that I encountered a couple of time already.
