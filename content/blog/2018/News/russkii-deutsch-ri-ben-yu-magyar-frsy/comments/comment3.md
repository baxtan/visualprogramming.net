@jerry: thanks for the pointer. link to german chat fixed.

Unfortunately, this is also going to spread out documentation and information about vvvv even more which is very bad I think.{{< /box >}}
this anticipated critizism is exactly what what the above text tries to counter already: the hope is that too the contrary, as more people of different backgrounds get to take part in the community, the richer it becomes. the more opportunities we offer for people to get in touch, the more likely it is that vvvv gets a strongly founded knowledgebase.

there should be ways specified by the people behind vvvv of bringing that documented knowledge of those channels back to the international community{{< /box >}}
if you read carefully, we mentioned that each of the rooms is hosted by a long-term member of the community who has exactly that understanding already and will be sensitive enough to share important information as they see fit. 

the whole idea arose, when we found a foreign-language forum dedicated to vvvv that was active for some time but then abandoned. with this attempt we want to make clear that just because you don't speak english you don't have to hide in some corner of the internet. we're here to help everyone as good as we can. there isn't one language that fits all and we're trusting community members that speak more than one language to act as bridges.
