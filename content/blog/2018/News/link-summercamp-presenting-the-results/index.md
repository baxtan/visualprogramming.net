LINK was a blast!



## Timeline
Different use-cases have different timeline or cueing needs. We asked at the summer camp if we can identify recurring scenarios and work towards a modular set of nodes and an editor to build custom timelines quickly? Having a proper timeline in VVVV/VL is one major development topic in the community. You can find our meeting notes and the discussion in [https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/link-topics-1-timeline/16543](this%20forum%20thread).

## 3D Engine
The topic framed a discussion about which 3D Engine suits best for vvvv and VL and what are the requirements from different use cases and perspectives. Direct3d, OpenGL or Vulkan and since a few days xenko. All possible with vvvv/VL but what does a library of nodes look like for the things we want to do. What's the basics, what's needed, what's a bonus? You can find our meeting notes and the discussion in this forum thread

## Integrating libraries
Another topic was very popular. Since VL now makes it particularly simple to integrate basically any .net library into vvvv/VL, many participants wanted to work on special third party libraries and build nodesets for that. So we asked: What are common patterns, best practices when importing and wrapping third-party libraries for use in a visual-programming language? You can find our resulting meeting notes and the discussion in this forum thread

## Machine Learning
Being the buzz of 2018, ML can be beautifully integrated with visual programming concepts. Particulary attendee Hayden Anyasi has been working on the topic and a vvvv/VL integration over the last couple of month. Many attendees contributed ideas and discussion on easy to use software patterns to make ML accessible for all. You can find our resulting meeting notes in this forum thread.

## Authoring Environment
vvvv is a multipurpose toolkit, VL is even much more general. Too general for some. What future target groups can be identified, what are their specific needs on the authoring environment of VL, how to best work towards those? We had very broad and intense discussions about these questions. You can find our meeting notes in this forum thread.
