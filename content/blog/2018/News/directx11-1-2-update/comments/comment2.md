concerning the shoutbox discussion about being a patron of this project and payment convenience. in my opinion vux was and is very generous, putting this crazy amount of work into this project and making it free to use for ages (6 years already?). how many **companies** use DX11 on a professional level and not pay a dime ?

the idea of patreon as i understood it,  is giving a dev some predictable monthly income. costs like food and rent are monthly too.

it does not help (from my perspective) to propose something like : "there might be a project which can pay something to the dev at some point" , that's just vague. that doesn't help to support a continuous development.

vux made monthly options available for everyone. time to give something back.

and in case you misunderstood this rant, i'm not voting for patreon here. if you find an agreement with vux outside of patreon, that's totally cool as well. 

thanks.

at this point we are at 34000 downloads vs. 15 patrons.
