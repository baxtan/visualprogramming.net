is it possible to not use mips, it radically changes the look of some of my projects that rely on no mips. Especially egde is important.

{{< box >}}Also since it got implemented, TextureFX shaders that can use "wantmips" now do so (Edge, Blur, BlurDirectional, BlurGlow, BlurPerfector, DistortFlow, DropShadow, UnsharpMask)
.They are all faster in that scenario.:vux:
