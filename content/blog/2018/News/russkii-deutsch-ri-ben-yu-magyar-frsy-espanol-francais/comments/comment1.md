I like the general idea of diversity and lowering barriers. Unfortunately, this is also going to spread out documentation and information about vvvv even more which is very bad I think.
I don't say it shouldn't happen, but there should be ways specified by the people behind vvvv of bringing that documented knowledge of those channels back to the international community. Do you have any ideas on that?

We should also think of incentives for people to join back into the international community and maybe learn English, is a valuable life skill.
