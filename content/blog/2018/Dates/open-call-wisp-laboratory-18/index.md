**Open Call | Wisp Laboratory ‘18**

![](20280234_1394579100577790_3575782143021264709_o-1920x1280.jpg) 

We’re pleased to announce the international Open Call for the second edition of Wisp Laboratory at Kontor80 in Leipzig, which will happen from 10th to 16th of September.
After last year’s successful week of building a 3D speaker setup and realising a 360° visualisation setup together with the participants, Wisp Laboratory is back for its second year.
We welcome audio and video artists from across the globe to apply for this unique lab. The Laboratory is limited up to 20 participants. The aim is to encourage and increase meeting points and the interaction between people. Together we will reconstruct architecturally the audiovisual phenomenon through concerts & performances with collaborative real-time systems. 
From 10th to 14th of September the participants will set-up a 3D Audio and 360° projection environment together with the lab hosts and have time to prepare their shows for the final presentation. In the nights of the 15th and 16th of September the results will be presented to an audience in a public event.

Lab Hosts
The lab will be facilitated by Felix Deufel (Audio Host) and Paul Schengber (Video Host) and David Simmons (Video & Audio Host) of Wisp Collective.

Location
The location of the lab days and performance nights will be Kontor80, Torgauer Straße 80, Leipzig.

Deadline for Applications is the 31st of July!
