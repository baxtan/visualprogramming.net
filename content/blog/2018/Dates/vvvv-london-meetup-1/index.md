London peeps!

This a bit on short notice: Following up on the legendary [v4wednesdays](http://www.v4wednesday.com/p/what-is-v4wednesday.html) hosted a while ago by a certain {{< user "hayden" >}} we're happy to announce a new London meetup this thursday! The lovely people of [The Old Baths](https://www.theoldbaths.co.uk) are hosting us, horray!

Come by, have a drink and show us your latest patcheridoos. Or just do the drinks and relax...

From our side expect a little preview on how we're [integrating with Xenko](/blog/2018/vl-xenko-3d-engine-update-1). 

If you feel like, [please RSVP](https://gettogether.community/events/373/vvvv-london-meetup-1/).

Looking forward to seeing you!
