#  Attention patchers! Save the date!
We're planning to spend some good times.
Save the date for LINK, the very first VVVV summer camp.

The summer camp will take place from August 8th to August 12th this year at a wonderful and peaceful sight near Berlin. The camp will be a short vacation from your everyday life, a time for ideas and projects you never found the time for. 

You are willing to bring your ideas and developments and this communtiy further? Then this is the place for you!

Nota bene: There will be only a super limited amount of seats available. The summercamp is not like an academy or workshop. You are not coming to learn. Here you are coming to share and spend quality time together while bringing forward your developments and ideas for future developments.

Expect 5 fantastic days at the lake with tents, barbecue, wine and overheating notebooks.

So save that date now. 
Details on everything and how to apply for it will follow soon here. 

happy eastern
