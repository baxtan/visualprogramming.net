We are happy to be hosted by Ri-Make, that is a sort of squat in a dismissed  bank, for few installations and a free vvvv workshop!

The workshop will be on saturday 17th March 2018, in the afternoon. In the last Patcher Kucha I organized I knew many people from Brera Accademy in Milan and noticed and increased interest in vvvv.

Thanks also to {{< user "fusomario" >}} who is spreading the vvvvord really hard, there will be few vvvv installations hosted.

My installation is related to mathematics, of course, and let user interact with music generated by prime numbers and tells the user their history while a bitcoin data graph in real time is showed... in some way they are related.

On the other hand {{< user "fusomario" >}} will present two installations (of course using vvvv, otherwise italian mafia gang is disappointed): one is hard to believe at first, there is some vegetable connected with an arduino to get its feelings into an IObox. I saw with my eyes and it is true: the vegetable responds to stimuli (light, sounds and caresses) , connects with people, and manifests its feelings.

I have heard other people from Brera will show other installations using vvvv.

Come to vvvvisit us!
