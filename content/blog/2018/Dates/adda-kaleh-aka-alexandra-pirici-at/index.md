Adda Kaleh is a musical project of first league performance artist Alexandra Pirici. 
Come have a brake from the beers at the Art Tent on thursday and/or friday at 19:30 for a show made both by woman and robot. Or something inbetween.

If you are from hhhhere, donâ€™t hesitate to say hi, ggml will be scriptkid for the night.
