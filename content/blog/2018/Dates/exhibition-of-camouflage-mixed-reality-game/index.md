I am pleased to invite you to the exhibition of our VR project Camouflage at Laboratorio Arte Alameda in Mexico City soon.

[Me](http://mariajudova.net) and [Andrej](http://id144.org) teamed up with former Rambert choreographers Renaud Wiser and Patricia Okenwa to playfully explores the ways digital technologies enrich and/or suppress our senses
