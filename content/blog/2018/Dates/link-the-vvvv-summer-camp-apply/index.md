sun sun sun, here we come!

We hereby launch the first vvvv summer camp and we call it: LINK
Check out its [website](http://www.link-summercamp.de) for all info.

It is all great and shiny with only one caveat: unfortunately the number of people we can host is limited to 25. This is why we have to run a simple application process and depending on the number of applicants we will have the difficult task to tell some of you that they cannot come. booohh..we know.

Please don't hesitate to apply though, we're hoping to assemble a group of not only the usual suspects but also to get to know some new faces! 

Also if you cannot attend for the whole time, join us on the public sunday. More information on the website.

So, in a nutshell:
- 5 days of patching in the sun on the shore of a quiet lake
- we camp and cook and clean-up together
- 130km north-west of berlin
- 260€ with all food and drinks inclusive

Convinced? Then go and [apply here](http://www.link-summercamp.de/apply) directly.
Any questions? post@link-summercamp.de
