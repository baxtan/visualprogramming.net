helo together. I just wanted to say a few words on the location.

the great thing about the location is that the owners are not running a business there. From time to time there are festivities for friends like birthdays and weddings. Having new people there like us is something new there as well. During DDR times the space was taken from the family and was used as a youth summer camp. After DDR the space was given back to the family with the benefit of the youth camp hall and some working facilities that are now so good to have. The great thing about the sight is that literally nobody else is there. No neighbors, no nothing. It is our private space with a huuge private lake. But to set a camp up it requires a lot of work in advance. So the costs are basically split in 25€/25€ per person per day. The first half for 3 meals, plus unlimited radler, moskow mules, water, coffee, etc etc.. the other half goes for running the huge space, paying the housekeeper, water and power consumption, have a company emptying the pit twice, setup, cooking, shopping, hosting etc.

And a word on equipment. Of course we can bring stuff with the car from Berlin. We can also help to organize equipment like tents and hardware from Berlin. We know it is much easier for people who can just jump in the car. Therefore we will have a meeting point at berlin train station on Wednesday morning for all the attendees. The travel from there is much more fun together! Maybe we even shuttle you. That's still open. We'll check services and prices. Once you are at the location. No more money is needed. (Except for your trip back home) Lets make this one happen, then we know how it turns out. Maybe we want to do it again, and maybe also somewhere else. Always open!

..for those who already know they cannot take part. I just think it would be still good to know what you would have liked to work on. maybe start a forum thread about it.

best 
david for the team
