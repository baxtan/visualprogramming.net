i would be ok with the cost, but having to bring stuff like sleeping bag, tent, matters, lan cable(?) on top of vive and notebook and soundcard,(part of the project i would be interested in working on) and flying and then getting to place for just 4 days is a bit over the top imo, seems not very good for people that cant jump into car and just drive there, would be nice to have a place that is bit convenient for international community
