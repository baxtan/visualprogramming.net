a suggestion for cost reduction for the next one: we can do this thing in our weekend house as well in the hills next to lake balaton, it can accomodate 8 people in the house and there's a huge field for tents, civilization is still close enough that you can just have a longer walk to the nearest shop if something is missing, there's 4G (or at least 3G) we have unlimited mobile internet here on which you can even download Visual Studio or other 10+ Gb packages. It's totally free to use for a week (it's property of my family) so the cost per person can be reduced a lot. Hungary is also dirt cheap with its third world grade economy so food and tourism is usually half if not third of the costs as in Germany (though the closest town is undergoing rapid gentrification so wouldn't bet on that too much). vegetables are also grown at the place
disadvantages though:
there's no direct lake access; technically speaking there are neighbours but they also have their own big field so they are not really close; no housekeeping service, so we have to clean up after ourselves and take care of the place; no industrial grade kitchen, we only have a small one but we have a big grill and fireplace.
It's just a suggestion though which might be easily opposed with stuff I didn't think of.
