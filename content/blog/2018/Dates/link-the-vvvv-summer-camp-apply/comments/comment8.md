Like @{{< user "sebescudie" >}} pointed out, we would like to underline that people from all different backgrounds are very welcome to be part of LINK and we would especially like to encourage those, who don't see themselves as developers but as users or thinkers to join us for discussions and develop concepts and ideas around vvvv/vl. The outcome of your proposal doesn't have to be a piece of software.

If you don't have a tent or sleeping bag or you are struggling with something else, please don't hesitate to contact us.
