**Introduction**

''VVVV.js features many essential JavaScript and WebGL programming methods packed in a set of over 300 nodes. The browser-based patch editor enables you to get started right now on any platform and it is possible to quickly deploy your application to web and mobile.
*\*\*Recently VVVV.js received a huge update which implements advanced rendering techniques like physical based rendering, instancing and depth-buffer based post effects.\*\**
