helo evvvveryone,

we're happy to announce that we'll be hosting a [Retune 2018](https://retunefestival.de/2018/) satellite on September 28th.

wanna take your first simple steps with vl? this is your chance: we'll be hosting 2 (identical) workshops. you can choose between:
- one from 10 to 13h
- the other from 14-17h

the workshop will walk you through examples using the only recently released [2d graphics library (Skia](/blog/2018/vl.skia)) and the [OpenCV library](/blog/2018/vl-opencv-is-in-da-house) for computervision. you'll learn how with only a few clicks you can achieve quite complex results using vl.
