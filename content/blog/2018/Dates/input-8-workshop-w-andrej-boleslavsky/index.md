<WORKSHOP> #8 w/ Andrej Boleslavský

➖ Mixing Reality using VVVV toolkit ➖

Workshop is intended for artist, designers and developers to get started with VVVV, the platform for visual programming used for real-time motion graphics, video, audio and ever VR.

Andrej will introduce the basic concepts of the VVVV; an environment designed for creative use, which allows fast and flexible runtime editing without syntax errors. If you never tried programming - here called patching - you will love VVVV. If you tried programming before, you will love it even more.

➖ Instruction for participants:
- Workshop is aimed at interaction designers, digital and new media artists
- No previous knowledge of programming is required; the workshop is for beginners.
- Bring your own PC with Windows 10 or MacBook with Boot Camp
- 3-button mouse with scrollwheel
- Latest vvvv version and addonpack installed

Andrej Boleslavský (SK/CZ) is an independent digital artist purposing technology in the fields of new media art, virtual reality, light installations and physical computing. His work also maintains a strong fascination with the entanglement of nature and technology. In his collaborative works with digital artist Mária Júdová he explores the boundary between physical and digital. He has developed many interactive installations and lectured on open source and creative coding tools. In addition to his work he is actively involved as a technologist for other artists and interaction designers. VVVV is his tool of choice since 2008.
