Berliners and non berliners.

We thought it's time for a first VVVV Meetup in Berlin, which will hopefully turn into a series of patcher kucha style evenings.

The meetup is for vvvv and VL interested open minds in Berlin. It is a place to meet and exchange ideas and experiences. It is open to anyone who wants to join, no matter if you are a vvvv expert or beginner, a famous or breadless artist, a designhead or technologist, a piano player or techno musician.

Thankfully we will be hosted by Lieke and Alfredo who are running the fantastic space [](https://spektrumberlin.de). It's a nice exhibition, performance and community building space. There will be a bar serving us drinks and some people around. Thank you Lieke & Alfredo. 

Next steps: 
# Drop us a mail, comment or forum post if you like to show something. We will announce some line-up soon.
# If you like: make yourself a member of our brand new meetup group on meetup.com [](https://www.meetup.com/VVVV-Meetup-Berlin)
# And check yourself in for the first meetup [](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/VVVV-Meetup-Berlin/events/251273271)

Looking forward to meet you!

Ann-Katrin & David
