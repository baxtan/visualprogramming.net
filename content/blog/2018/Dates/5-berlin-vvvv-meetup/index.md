Note:
The only thing that changed during our streak of 5 meetups is, that we finally found an even cozier place to host our announcements and coordinations: [gettogether](https://gettogether.community/vvvv/) 

We still feed [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/VVVV-Meetup-Berlin/events/254785074/) with those infos for now.
