Berlin Patchers.

Our first meetup was a blast. See the [protocol](https://vvvv.org/404) if you missed it.

Lets keep it up.
Here is the second one.

This time we will have {{< user "lasal" >}} (see <http://aristidesgarcia-blog.tumblr.com/>) exposing some insights of his latest project. Hopefully this gets us inspired, so that we can have spontaneous discussions/talks/showcases following.

So, feel free to bring your project/notebook/questions or whatever you want to share with the community.

There will be a bar serving us drinks.
There will also be other people around as well.

Thanks go to Lieke and Alfredo who are running the fantastic space <https://spektrumberlin.de>. 
Thank you Lieke & Alfredo.
