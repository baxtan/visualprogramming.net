Berlin Patchers.

On short notice:

We're looking forward to have [Quadrature](http://quadrature.co) giving us insights to their latest and greytest work.

Quadrature is a berlin based art collective. Their works revolves around space: data from space, humans in space, messages from space. The results are kinetic installations, performances, graphics, sculptures (actually anything but video) - and 99% of the time vvvv is at least involved in the making process.... They will show current work in progess, e.g. a new sound performance for the Kubus at ZKM.

As always, feel free to bring your project/notebook/questions or whatever you want to share with the community. We have space and time for spontaneous presentations!

There will be a bar serving us drinks. There will also be other poeple around as well. This time we share the space with the openframeworks community.

Thanks go to Lieke and Alfredo who are running the fantastic space <https://spektrumberlin.de>.
