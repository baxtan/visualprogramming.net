well this is the mental load I was talking about! you need to put first point into future roadmap: future roadmap

just a side note, vvvv is one of many tools most of us use, we dont live the forum and chat and everything 24/7, and it can get hard to track everything, and ask everytime, and search forums etc.
sometimes i go months without using vvvv at all
