@velcrome @StiX @lasal if you read carefully on the [roadmap](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/roadmap.html) page, it says at the very top "..we're planning to outline future milestones to give you an idea where this is all heading..." and then there's a section prepared called "Upcommming Milestones" which is not yet filled out. seems this is too subtle for a hint that we're working on a future roadmap that we're comfortable to share. exactly triggered by recent increased requests for such. we're on it..

regarding "more transparency" i need to make sure everyone is aware of these, because i often hear of people not being aware of some:
* we do this monthly wrapup exactly to better inform everyone about what is being worked on. not only by us, but also by contributors
* we have the [devvvv blog](/blog/23) where we share latests developments as they happen
* we frequently prerelease to the [wip section](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/wip) 
* we have [instant alpha builds](downloads/alphas) where everyone can play with our latest bugs
* we're available in a <https://riot.im/app/#/room/#vvvv:matrix.org> basically 24/7 for everyone
