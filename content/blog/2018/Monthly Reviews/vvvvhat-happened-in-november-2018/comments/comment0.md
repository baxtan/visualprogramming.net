Hey joreg, I saw it a few times now, you seem to mistake the meaning of the word Roadmap.

A roadmap is always a strategic plan that you want to pursue in the future, not something you make in retrospect.
Yes I know, ever since the Great Tease of 2010 the whole devvvv team is allergic to make "promises" publicly, and hence there was hardly any information on what you are working on and how you prioritize tasks internally. 
People sometimes complained about this fact, or even demanded a Roadmap (e.g. @mburk at LINK, or @jerry [here](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vvvv-ecosystem-and-design/16405)).

Now I don't think people will be too crazy about a "Roadmap" that is solely a description of finished actions. It is not a roadmap, just because you choose to call it that.
I guess the demand for more transparency is still there, just look at the likes @elias got in [this thread](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-feature-paste-c-code-into-vl-window-as-nodes/16957/15), when just casually listing his short-term priorities.

So yes, you could push this aside as petty nit-picking, but I hope you take this more as a friendly prod to think about why people keep on asking for a roadmap.
