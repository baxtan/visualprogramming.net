this is what i would love to see from roadmap:
https://www.notion.so/d3fac214ac9549f38f7990d33268e3a3?v=5c8d1326be184310923c40a7de2f6af8
features and topics that have direct links to forum posts, where you can discuss, etc.

but we can do with something more general
but the discussed features should be on one page, with some possible version plan, and forum link
i think it would systematize never ending discussions and mentions of this or that feature
and would actually lift some mental load from you and the whole community
