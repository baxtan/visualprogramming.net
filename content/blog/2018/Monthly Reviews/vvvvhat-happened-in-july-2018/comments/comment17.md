Today, I went to the beachfront with my kids.
I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old 
daughter and said "You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear." She 
placed the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.
She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is totally off topic 
but I had to tell someone!
