Summertime...

...and the patching goes easy. And we have a [release candidate for beta37](/blog/2018/beta37-release-candidate) out! Please take a moment to test it against your latest projects and report any problems in the forum using the *alpha* tag. 

We added two more features to the alphas within the last month:
* [Groups and Categories](/blog/2018/vl-groups-and-categories)
* [New Serialization Nodes for VL](/blog/2018/vl-serialization)

For the brave we also pre-released the long announced [2d Rendering Engine for VL based on Skia](/blog/2018/vl.skia). Note that this is still an alpha-grade release and we are very much hoping for your feedback on it! But this also means that for projects that don't necessarily need 3d-rendering you can now most likely start thinking full VL! Who will show us the first such project?

The [2nd Berlin Meetup](https://vvvv.org/404) has happened and now [http://link-summercamp.de/ Summer Camp](http://link-summercamp.de/) is coming up shortly. Even if you're not attending, we'd be happy if you [participate in the discussions](/blog/2018/link-summercamp-presenting-the-topics) we'll be having there. And maybe you can make it to our next [meetup at the lake](/blog/2018/3-berlin-vvvv-meetup-at-link-open-sunday) on August 12th!
