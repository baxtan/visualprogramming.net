we did it!

beta36 is out, after only a few months overtime, packed with new features. please read the [release notes](/blog/2018/vvvv50beta36) carefully to learn about all the goodies. judging by the >100 downloads a day and not too many crazy bugreports since, i think it is fair to say at this point that it turned out well. if there is still a particular reason you're using an older version, please make sure to let us know about it!

are you into computer-vision? wanna see one particular thing you can do with beta36? check out our [first episode of vvvvTv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hPH5CokxwQ) in which we cover a [new computer-vision library for vl](/blog/2018/vl-opencv-is-in-da-house) available as a prerelease now.

planning your summer travels? save the date for [/blog/2018/link-the-vvvv-summer-camp-2018 - the vvvv summercamp](/blog/2018/link-the-vvvv-summer-camp-2018)!

and a new book it out about learning vvvv: [it is in chinese](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a220o.1000855.w4004-3921166541.12.3de8e1c8AjYVfz&id=566275442271). so only the majority of people on earth now got a chance to get in touch with vvvv, horray! many thanks to the authors for their dedication!
