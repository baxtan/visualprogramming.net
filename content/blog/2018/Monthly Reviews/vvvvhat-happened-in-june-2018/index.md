hola,

que patcha? we did it. as announced here last time, we've finally finished our [cleanup of the VL.Corelib](/blog/2018/vl-corelib-cleanup). further we've released [improved File IO](/blog/2018/vl-improved-file-io) nodes and a little new feature to [frame your patches](/blog/2018/vl-frame-your-patches). we've also reworked how groups and categories work which we'll introduce in a blogpost soon. these then were the biggest chunks that we had planned for the coming release. so we're now soon reaching everyones favorite: release-candidate time! 

and on july 10th, the [second berlin meetup](/blog/2018/2-berlin-vvvv-meetup) is happening, organized by {{< user "a_a_a_a" >}} and {{< user "sebl" >}}, horray!
