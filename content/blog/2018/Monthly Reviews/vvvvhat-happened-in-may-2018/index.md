wow, 

what a month. again so many new things... while we've still not managed to finalize our rework of the vl corlib, as mentioned here last month, you can already follow our developments using [alpha builds](https://vvvv.org/downloads/previews) if you're curious. we're now mostly done and are working on documentation and a blogpost to give you an easy overview of whats new.

meanwhile we've released an [update to our HTMLTexture nodes](/blog/2018/htmltexture-now-for-dx11-and-more) which are now working for both DX9 and DX11!

also there is a [new episode of vvvvTv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-Rx49OH7Ic) up about the oldy-but-goldy {{< contribution "vvvv-telegram" "telegram contribution" >}} by {{< user "motzi" >}}.

signup for [http://link-summercamp.de/](http://link-summercamp.de/) is now closed. looks like all spots are taken, but if you were too late and are still interested, don't hesitate to still contact us. if anyone cannot take their spot we may still be able to...fill you in.

berliners save the date: **June 12th** will be our first [vvvv/vl meetup](/blog/2018/berlin-vvvv-meetup). as of this writing already 11 participants have signed up! looking forward to getting to know you..

and finally: we've started collecting [Universities and other Educational Institutions](https://vvvv.org/documentation/educational-institutions) that are using vvvv/vl. we got 9 so far. please add yours there, if it is still missing!
