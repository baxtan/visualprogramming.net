we did it,

[vvvv 50beta37 is out](/blog/2018/vvvv50beta37)! and you're hopefully using it already. since we haven't gotten any problematic reports since, it seems fair to say that we managed to get out another quite stable release. if you find otherwise, you know how to reach us in the [forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/) or [chat](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/chat.html). we're here to help!

so what next? 
ouright, let's wrap this up a bit: our goal for the vvvv 50 series was to add vl as a first class patching citizen. and obviously there are still a few ideas of how to make it even better, but for the biggest parts we'd argue: mission accomplished. we hear people are using it to their favor, we're using it ourselves, time for the next big steps.

as [announced previously](/blog/2018/vl-threedee) we've started work on implementing a 3d-engine, which will, when done, add the biggest still missing set of nodes to vl. and we're lucky to having found a perfect project to work on alongside implementing the engine. together with [marshmellowlaserfeast](http://marshmallowlaserfeast.com) we're working on their new multi-person vr-installation. it will be fully implemented with what we still call vl-standalone using the [xenko](http://xenko.com/) powered engine. it feels a bit like in the early days of vvvv, when we were working on the [very first vvvv project](http://www.meso.net/expo02) with a pre-public version of vvvv that didn't yet have spreading and a lot of nodes were developed specifically for the project. anyway, the project is scheduled to open in december. we're kinda half-way there and things look and feel very smooth so far...

so if all goes according to plan we should have a good understanding of xenko and standalone by the end of the year. which should include an announcement of how and when it will be available for you. 

can also report from our little [workshop](/blog/2018/vvvvvl-workshop-at-retune-2018) we had a week ago: it was the first ever time we handed out a version of vl-standalone to unsuspecting participants. 15 out of 20 haven't even used vvvv before and it was interesting to see that those seemed to have less issues with using it than those coming with preconceptions of how things used to work in vvvv. good..

changing topic once more: as a direct outcome of talks at [http://link-summercamp.de/](http://link-summercamp.de/) we've launched our [multi-language chat initiative](/blog/2018/русский-deutsch-日本語-magyar-فارسی-español-français) hoping to get closer with people who are not native english speakers. if you know anyone who could be interested in this, please point them to it.

and finally: {{< user "tonfilm" >}} wrote about fancy way for [debugging dx11 frames with nvidia nsight](/blog/2018/debug-dx11-frames-with-nvidia-nsight) he found recently.

has this just turned into a full-blown monologue? geee..
