okok,

have we mentioned beta36 yet? it is still a release candidate and about to be released soon. quasi. so please take this last chance and make sure your latest projects will work with it when it will be released, by getting the [latest candidate](/blog/2018/beta36-release-candidate) and testing them against it. in the unlikely event that you have something bugging you, prettyplease let us know. in the comments, in the [forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/) or in the [chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#vvvv:matrix.org). thanks.

in case you've missed the february news from the devvvv room, please catch up here. both of these can be tested in the candidate already:
* [VL: BinarySearch for your Keyframes](/blog/2018/binary-search-for-your-keyframes)
* [VL: Image Exchange Interfrace](/blog/2018/vl-image-exchange-interface)

and meanwhile we're already working on a branch towards b36.1 scheduled for in about 2 months after b36 release. it will mostly focus on a cleanup of all vl libraries and finally opensourcing them so we can start accepting contributions.
