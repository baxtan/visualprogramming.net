time flies,

as mentioned in last months update, we're in the middle of realizing the very first project entirely with vl standalone while at the same time integrating vl with [Xenko](http://xenko.com/). It is a complex multiplayer VR project involving 2 groups of 6 players each, who interact with each other and a beautifully shaded environment. And the ride couldn't have been more smooth so far. The project kinda develops itself along all the research we put into it that goes directly into the future usability of vl for everyone. Still a month to go until the opening...

Meanwhile here is a first peak at [how we're working with xenko](/blog/2018/vl-xenko-3d-engine-update-1) at the moment. While at {{< user "tonfilm" >}} wrote another blogposts about debugging dx11 rendering, this time using [RenderDoc](/blog/2018/debug-dx11-frames-with-renderdoc).
