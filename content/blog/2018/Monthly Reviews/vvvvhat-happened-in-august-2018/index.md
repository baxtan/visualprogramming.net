what a summer...

you missed [link](http://link-summercamp.de/)? well..you were missed too. so what happened? basically: patch, lake, food. to get a bit of a glimpse, check the [final presentations of the focus groups](http://www.link-summercamp.de/results/).

next chance to meet your fellow patchers in the realworld is our [4th berlin vvvv meetup](/blog/2018/4-berlin-vvvv-meetup) on september 5th.

we've still not released our [candidate for beta37](/blog/2018/beta37-release-candidate) since we had a few buggers to fix thanks to your feedback. if no unexpected events occur, this should drop really soon now. 

and the latest big news is that we've announced to have started work on a [3d-pack for vl](/blog/2018/vl-threedee) with all bells and whistles. it is a lot of fun to play with and looking really smooth so far. if all goes well, we should be able to show something before the end of this year...

if you're looking for a job, check this [announcement by intolight](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/intolight-looking-for-freelancers-in-aug-sep-2018/16661).

## Contributions

we got one new contribution this month:
* {{< contribution "shaderbox" >}} by {{< user "umanema" >}}

and then, as a direct outcome of a discussion at link, to boost the "work in progress" section on our forum, there are a lot of new things to find here, mostly for vl. again, the idea is to show what you're working on early, even before you have something useful to share. like this we're hoping to prevent that folks start working on the same things in parallel. so be sure to check out these:
* [Works In Progress](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/wip)

and we got two teasers: [one](/blog/interpole-(help)-preview) and [two](/blog/root-192)
