jannuary 2018,

or as i'd like to call it: a new dawn.

so many things...where to start... probly here if you haven't yet: [vvvv-in-numbers-2017](/blog/2018/vvvv-in-numbers-2017)
then an apology for the current release-candidate hiatus. we've been too optimistic end of december, when we let out the first. meanwhile 3 more things got finalized:
* [Aspect Ratio and Projection Space](/blog/2018/aspect-ratio-and-projection-space)
* [Small Changes Regarding Enums in vvvv](/blog/2018/small-changes-regarding-enums-in-vvvv)
* [Dynamic DX11 Buffers in vl](/blog/2018/dynamic-dx11-buffers-in-vl)
a new RC is scheduled to be announced this week.

also, the five part vl for vvvv users series of videos is now complete: [part 1](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-for-vvvv-users-key-differences-1-5/15919), [part 2](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-for-vvvv-users-how-to-patch-2-5/15948), [part 3](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-for-vvvv-users-spreads-vs-spreading-pt-1-3-5/15956), [part 4](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-for-vvvv-users-spreads-vs-spreading-pt-2-4-5/16027), [part 5](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-for-vvvv-users-spread-of-spread-5-5/16028). it is basically the workshop i gave at node17. it picks you up where you are as a vvvv user and shows you how the basic things are mostly the same in vl but only when it comes to spreading you need to learn about loops instead. and once you're there you'll not want to look back...

...like e.g. this doctor, who was kind enough to give us an update on the [status of his latest developments](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/kairos-software/15506/18). must watch!

what next:
we have a few independent libraries in the works at the moment that we're planning to announce properly in the coming weeks each. for the bravvvve ones among you, go check our public repositories already:
- [VL.OpenCV](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.OpenCV) bringing computervision to vl
- [VL.GStreamer](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.GStreamer) bringing audio and video playback to vl
- [VL.glTF](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.glTF) bringing 3d assets to vl
and even more to come... but beware: there aren't really instructions yet on how to use those. so you might as well want to wait for the announcements. 

with beta36 hopefully out soon we'll then make plans for the next release. high priorities are endless, will be some tough decisions to make again.

otherwise sadly not so much in the gallery last month. seems everyone is too busy networking their stuff socially. and then i stumbled upon this: https://vimeo.com/search/sort:latest?q=vvvv with many more recent uploads.. but please don't forget to share your works also in our [gallery](/blog/24) to show people having their first contact with vvvv.org, what you're doing with it.

and on a final note: {{< user "tekcor" >}} has announced a workshop titled [Chaos - Noise - Motion](/blog/2018/workshop-chaos-noise-motion) that will take place on march 10th in leipzig.
