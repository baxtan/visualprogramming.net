Please welcome beta38.1, 

which basically, only fixes one bug that got introduced with the [**beta38 release**](/blog/2018/vvvv50beta38) and prevented certain VL patches from loading up. 
Sorry about that! Heads will roll in quality management, guaranteed!

Apart from that, you see some new *swizzle* nodes as well as more help texts for nodes in our core library. Also, the VL splash screen is not top-most anymore.

And if you haven't already, now is a good time to testdrive our two "prerelease" packages that both come with plenty of examples to explore:
    - [VL.OpenCV](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.OpenCV) for all your computervision tasks
    - [VL.Skia](/blog/2018/vl-skia-update) for all your 2d rendering needs

And for the very brave there is a lot of good stuff ready for testing in the [work-in-progress section in the forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/wip).

That's about it,
for now,
Yours,
devvvvs
