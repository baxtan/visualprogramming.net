no! usually there are no breaking changes from one release to the next. ie. usually you can open documents saved with a new version still with an older version. we take a lot of care to not cause such troubles. in the rare cases it happens, we are extra explicit about it (like above) so everyone knows and can prepare. hope this clarifies.
