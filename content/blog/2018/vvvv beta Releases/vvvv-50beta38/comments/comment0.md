cool for the auto-init/split and all, also looking forward for the progress you've made with xenko.

but the backwards-incompatibility is a shame. especially because I don't get why going from "single-value" to "single-value-or-many-values-or-xml" would stop parsing the old version.

I hope you find a way to mitigate that, maybe provide a converter of some sort. Not being able to upgrade any vl project is a slam in the face.
