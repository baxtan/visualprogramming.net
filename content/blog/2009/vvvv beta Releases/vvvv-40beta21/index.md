Easter is such a real shwopsy mopsy thing, if you know what we mean.

The new release comes with the following features:
* pixel precise 2d rendering within 3d scenes
* text and sprite rendering 
* billboards and onesided objects
* a more versatile Multiscreen technique
* spreadable ex9 primitives
* more performant caching with known switches and S+H nodes 
* faster patches in hidden tabs
* GUI enhancements for module writers (middleclick an iobox)
* HID nodes for driver development
* more possibilities for plugin developers (mesh and layer outputs, enums in and out)

And some more shwops and mops.

Get it at [Downloads](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads), be sure to have installed all the requirements listed under Additional Downloads and also don't forget the latest [addonpack](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/devvvveloping/addons/)!
Go for it!
Yours devvvvs, groups
