The Modified Toy Orchestra will be debuting our new album on the 13th and 14th of March at City Hall in Hong Kong.
Plastic Planet a concept album discussing the throw away nature of society and the ecological harm done by all of us, made using thrown away electronic toy, most of which originate from China, we are taking them home once again!
Visuals are done in vvvv (of course!) although there is a mix of generative and stop motion animation, as some of you may have seen at node! I'll also be mixing camera feeds in vvvv for this show too. Pictures hopefully will follow, if I can fit my cameras in my bag after everything else I'm trying to take!
If you can make it drop me a pm, it would be nice to talk!
