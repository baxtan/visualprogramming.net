Hello, 

back again from a longer trip to c++ and opencv – I'm happy to announce our next installation made with the great help of vvvv and arduino.  

This is a invite to our public talk and the official opening of our installation *die Dinge an sich*.

In cooperation with [designtransfer udk](http://www.designtransfer.udk-berlin.de/).
