we used vvvv to create an interactive installation for the "von hier nach dort" exhibition (ten years department of informations - university of applied sciences) in the landesmuseum in graz/austria.

our patch uses cameratracking for starting the game and counting the score (contour), youtube upload via commandline (unfortunately we disabled this feature because of legal reasons in the final version), replay at the end of each round and loads of funny dance movies..

the task is to perform shown dances.
startscreen video can be seen here: [vimeo-link](http://www.vimeo.com/2918441)
pics and videos will (hopefully) be include later..

the exhibition is opened til 8th february - free entry

so if someone is in graz feel free to check it out
