So here we go that's more than 70 new nodes to play with, hope you'll find some useful :)

Released in two flavors, flat version (all in the same folder, similar to addon pack, just copy in plugins), and folder based version, so you can pick which ones you want (Not recommended)

Note: If you copy folder based version using subfolders, you'll have different plugin path, so your patches won't work with people using flat based or potentially further addon packs. For expert only.


Please note that the box2d is still flat (as it probably been used before), so this one need to be copied in the plugins folder as is.
