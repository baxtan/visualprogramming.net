I am looking for cooperation for a media art project in public space. Some knowledge of tracking and projection are important.

The interactive media art environment is dealing with the function, use and perception of public space. It makes a reference to nowadays optionality of public space functions within an experiment of innovative media technology.

Cubes, placed in passage zones like train stations or pedestrian underpasses are the interface between passenger and artifact and invites them to play with. He is prompted to interact with them and to cause interaction between the objects.

The production will take part between mid august and end of September (should probably be done in 1-2 weeks, laid-back), if necessary October could be arranged too. The official premiere presentation will be at the beginning of November in Salzburg, Austria.

Budget is available, meaning your expenses and some payment will be covered. As well as a technical equipment will be available.

Contact me via [mail](http://blog.benju.net/contact/) or +43-699-81105810 for more information
