In the spirit of releasing early this is to announce a little tool called: [RemoterSA](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/boygrouping/remotersa.html)

It is supposed to help us remoting large number of clients in [glossary](glossary) scenarios but is not at all limited to the use in connection with vvvv. RemoterSA will soon be available as opensource under the LGPL and also run as a plugin-node within vvvv.

Please test heavily and [report your findings here.](http://legacy.vvvv.org/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?comments_parentId=25584&topics_threshold=0&topics_offset=1&topics_sort_mode=commentDate_desc&topics_find=&forumId=22)
