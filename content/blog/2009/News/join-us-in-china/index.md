We are the innovation and technology division at SYMA Asia, creating and developing interactive installations for commercial clients as well as museums, tourist sites, etc. 

In the last 3 years we have made a name in China as the "go-to" team for high-profile projects requiring creativity, technology skills and top-level execution. We were the official technology partner for Coke and Adidas in the Beijing Olympics, among many other major brands. We also work closely with Chinese and foreign governments (we're quite busy now preparing projects for Shanghai 2010 World Expo).

We are looking for full-time designers/developers with strong interest and experience in researching new concepts and technologies in several fields (augmented reality, ubiquitous computing, computer vision), as well as designing and developing prototypes and commercial-grade interactive installations and solutions - either using the available tools (vvvv, Virtools, etc) and/or programming from scratch (C++, C#, Java, etc).

If you think your profile suits the description above and you're interested in joining us in China (and working all around Asia and Middle East), contact me at ricardo.andrade@syma.com.cn asap and let's talk.

Thanks
Ricardo Andrade
Director
