Hi VVVVolks,
this year we ([kopffarben](http://kopffarben.de)) organize an Media-Installation-Exhibition in the course of the "berlin leuchtet" festival. So we are looking for interactive-Installations, light-art objects or just people who want help us. 

We have an really nice gallery for that ([FORUM Factory](http://www.forum-factory.de/)). There is a lot space to play with.

Hopefully we can provide a small amount of service charge. 
So maybe berlin based artists are preferred.

If you want be part of this project just comment here or better write us an Email.
