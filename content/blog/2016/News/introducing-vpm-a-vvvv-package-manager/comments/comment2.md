not too hard there's already a framework which wraps any command line tool into nice fancy responsive gui with switches sliders and dropboxes usign nw.js http://ugui.io/

browsing is a different problem. first idea I had in mind is using special git repositories which only contain vpack files and csx install scripts. A WPF app or a vvvv plugin/module can easily list and update that like NuGet in VS. That's actually quite good idea ;)
