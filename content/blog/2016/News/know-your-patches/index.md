After [Spreads](/blog/know-your-spreads!) we now bring to you an update to the documentation on all things [Patching](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/patching/index.html). It shouldn't have too much new info for the pro but is meant to be a complete reference to all we know about vvvv ourselves. and we added a lot of patch-selfies for your viewing pleasure, like this:

Please make sure to point to these pages when running a workshop. Speficically the [Patching Concepts](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/patching/patching-concepts.html) should give every noob an idea of how to work with vvvv. 

Know an old-school programmer who needs convincing that patching is the new coding? Point them to the [Programming Concepts](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/patching/programming-concepts.html) page where we tried to offer an introduction for those folks. 

See the main table of content below but also don't miss those 3 new pages:
