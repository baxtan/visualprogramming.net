well after a certain age it is kinda rich people's privilege. in my field I'm not mangling with human lives or money so people are less excited about my lack of official certification about my knowledge. Also for me it's easier to learn from the internet than from the russian/slavic/hungarian style "hit it until it learns it" education system
