NODE17 ol√©!

So [NODE17](https://nodeforum.org/) is taking place from **June 26th to July 2nd** and we're getting started planning the vvvvorkshop program. Let me introduce you to my co-curators {{< user "remony" >}}, [owner of the golden quad](https://flic.kr/p/s6pgcs) for her tireless engagement in NODE15s orga and longtime vvvv pro and NODE enthusiast {{< user "katzenfresser" >}}. This time around we want to share the joyful work of planning the educational program for the next NODE with you. In phase one we want to hear from you:

* **What workshops do you want to attend?**
* **What workshops can you offer to host?**

Don't be afraid to mention "too simple" or "too crazy" topics. Everything is possible at this stage. As every year we're planning to offer a wide range of workshops covering introductory to hardcore topics and we need to hear from you so we can best cover your needs.

### For details on how to contribute please read
* **[How to request a workshop](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/how-to-request-a-workshop/14252)**
* **[How to propose a workshop](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/how-to-propose-a-workshop/14253)**

Feel free to request/propose as many workshops as you like. Only before you do so please check if there is already a similar request/proposal and consider adding to that existing discussion rather than starting a new topic. Discussing entries is very much encouraged hoping that it can help us all to better define individual proposals/requests.

Then for both requests and proposals use the like-button of the topic to show your interest in it. The three of us will then look at the discussions and like-counts to get an idea of what's hot and what's not. Please note that a high like-count here will not be a guarantee for a workshop to take place as requested/proposed. We'll have more parameters to consider for each workshop than just the likes but they'll certainly be a strong factor for our decisions. 

### Deadline
This call doesn't have a strong deadline but we'll make a first curatorial assessment on **February 1st 2017**. So to maximize your chances of being heard make sure your entries are there before that day. What happens afterwards, we'll announce by then.

### What we offer to workshop hosts
* full NODE17 ticket
* accomodation for the whole week of the festival in Frankfurt
* travel costs to/from frankfurt
* catering on the days of your workshops

Happy brainstorming to you! Let us know if you have any further questions. We are very much looking forward to your submissions and discussions!
