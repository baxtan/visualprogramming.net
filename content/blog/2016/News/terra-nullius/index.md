Terra nullius is the “geological” activity of a software entity, in the disembodied and abstract nature of a computer system. This activity creates the variables of its orography, whose movement can be well-read in turn as sound variables. This micro/macro universe is observed/listened from the intimacy of an alien eye/ear that attends (without any intervention) to its natural evolution. Inside an infinite scale, a minimal, uninhabitable and impossible landscape gets created and destroyed, thanks to the fragile balance between opposite forces.
