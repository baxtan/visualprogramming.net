And now for something completely different, Csaba Hruska (a friend of mine) and his friend Péter Diviánszky is developing a powerful language called [LambdaCube 3D](http://www.lambdacube3d.com/) based on Haskell which makes graphics development easy yet keeping low-level control of what's happening. They already created backends for WebGL1.0, OpenGL ES 2.0, and OpenGL3.3 and now we found out with Csaba it would be fun to create a DirectX 11 backend and it would be even funnier to create a wrapper in vvvv for LamdaCube.

Join us on 19th March 4PM GMT or 5PM CET to see where we managed to push this integration and see its possibilities ;)

From now on i will ditch Twitch in favor of Youtube again because that provides me more info and their chat is persistent. Sorry German viewers you have to connect Chinese style.
this is our lovely link until youtube decides vveekend vvorkshops deserves a unique human-readable URL https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8Vqigdbq5Gam_6dcGdNBw
