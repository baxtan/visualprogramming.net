The NODE crew nevvvver sleeps and they put together this grande documentation of last years edition. Take a glass of your favorite drink and enjoy..

And then: Apparently it is happening again! Mark the date:

I'm actually off to Frankfurt in a few hours for our NODE17 kick-off meeting tomorrow. Too many ideas already...and of course, when it comes to planning the details of the workshop program that will involve a lot of your kind, we'll get to you. We're thinking about a bit more proper call/vote for workshops this time.. Until then show us what you're patching with!
