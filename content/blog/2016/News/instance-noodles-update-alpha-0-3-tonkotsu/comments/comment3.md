@tekor 
well it's a fairly naive implementation, you may find the resolution to be a limiting factor.  But after playing with raymarching it was actually very easy to make.

@u7angel
check help patches for combineSDF or SDFtoMesh.  Basically you can keep combining primitives with the combine node in a chain.
