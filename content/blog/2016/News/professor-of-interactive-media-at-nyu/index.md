Anyone looking for a job? There is an open position for an "Interactive Media Professor" at the [New York University in Abu Dhabi](http://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/) at the moment. The description reads like this:

*NYU Abu Dhabi is currently inviting applications for full time non-tenure track multi-year positions in the Interactive Media program, to begin Fall 2016. While technical fluency in computer programming and physical computing is a must, we are looking for someone who recognizes the aesthetic, cultural, and ethical implications of working with new technologies. Candidates must be able to continually engage with new tools and modes of expression and inspire students to do the same.  We are looking for someone who will continually re-invent the curriculum and its integration into the NYUAD liberal arts experience as an ongoing part of their own research in interactive media.*
