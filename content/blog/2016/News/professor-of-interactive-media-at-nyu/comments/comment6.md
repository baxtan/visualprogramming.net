Well with your skills probably it would be the best to be in a university that integrates the students from beginning on in the real research and publishing. Then it can be nice. There are some good computer graphics departments or human computer interaction in germany they do that, but anyway its annoying to go through other information science related first semester lectures. Then maybe what is left is an art studies but there you are usially on your own and there are no paper groups or anything that would be realy intelectualy satisfying but at least you get a degree..
