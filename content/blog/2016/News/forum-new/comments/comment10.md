a couple of updates:

* @sunep: an indicator of "new topics available in forum" is now available in the activities
* @manuel: there is now a link from userpage to forum-profile. the other way round is still missing
* mobile now has a header so you can navigate back to the main page
* @readme has shared a way to apply custom css-styling to the forum if you're not happy with the defaults, in [this topic](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vvvvelcome-to-the-new-forum/14189/12).
