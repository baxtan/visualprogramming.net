I am really happy that things are going well for you guys! 

Best thing is to have new young people that can grow with vvvv and get to point when it makes their living and they can afford the license, as it happened for me (I began with vvvv in high school and done lots of stuff in college with it). Workshops are imho best place for spreading of vvvv, because its world of difference if someone can guide you through beginning so I hope there will be lots of that in 2016 around the world. This leads me to the point, it would be great to have statistics about workshops that had VVVV lectures and if there is some correlation between number of workshops and usage of vvvv and licences.
