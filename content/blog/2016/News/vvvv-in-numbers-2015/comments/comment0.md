Thanks for taking the time, joreg. I always liked this stats stuff.
Now folks, really spread the word about  <flattr)(https://www.flattr.com>. For a community like ours, this is the perfect appreciation solution.

Ah, and maybe some stats about  <vvvv.js) would fit in nice. Since i had a quick'n'dirty use case recently i guess it might contribute some of the more desirable stats graphics in the future ;>
