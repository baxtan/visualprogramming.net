Hi @soundanalogous,

thank you for your info, very interesting!
Yes, I'm also one of "those" users checking for the Firmata for Teensy at the pjrc.com. Hope the situation about the "official" version will be more clear in the near future.

But still there are many custom and stripped Firmatas out there, which are not responding to all possible Requests.

I guess in addition we'll make one "Generic" module for the boards loaded with the official Firmata.

For sure, our current set of Arduino nodes is limited. We've had only these boards for testing and there is so many hardware in the wild. Our approach was to make it modular and customizable, so everyone can adapt these modules to the special boards they have.

Thank you for your effort keeping Firmata up-to-date with the new hardware!

Best,
Anton
