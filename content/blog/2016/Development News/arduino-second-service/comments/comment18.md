Hi guys,

can I connect output of DigitalRead to switch inputs of position for ServoWrite?
Idea is when someone push the button servo will change the position.
Pushbutton is working and I can read the output with DigitalRead, but I can connect it with switch for ServoWrite. Servo is also working but I can't to connect them together.

many thanks
Petr
