@sebl: this is not interesting for typical process nodes like a FlipFlop or MonoFlop. but think of a more complex case, like a processnode wrapping a device (eg. leap, kinect,..). in such cases you'll want to be able to hand out the state of the node for downstream nodes to get.. (or even set..) on that state. hope that make sense...

@microdee: we know that many people are waiting for this and we're not happy about our delays here. the thing is that we're hoping to be able to present a clear and simple overview of how to create libraries for vl instead of throwing a bunch of code at people and let them figure out themselves and by that produce a series of confused questions for us to answer. we're at it, it has top priority (like so many other things) and we can only ask you to give us some more time. updates will certainly follow.
