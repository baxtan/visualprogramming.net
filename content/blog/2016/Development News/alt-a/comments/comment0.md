great, I have been doing this using the about node and looking though the outputs multiple times before, but this is so much better.

there is just one little annoying detail when it is used on a high res display with scaling, it is not scaled accordingly and thus the text is tiny.

it would be nice if it could be scaled like the UI is being scaled and as a side not, it would be nice if we couldget the scaling of the screen in a node
