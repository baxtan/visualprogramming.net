Let me introduce you to the new About patch: Spiced up with some usefulness here is what Alt+A can now do for you:

### About vvvv
- which version of vvvv is running: x64 or x86, from which path (clickable to open explorer)
- is the correct (x64/x86) addonpack installed (there'll be a warning-sign if not)
- what other packs are installed
- what commandline parameters has vvvv been started with
- what search-paths are active

### About the system
- what's the IP-address of the PC
- what's the CPU of the PC
- what graphic-cards are present and how much RAM do they have
- what MIDI and COM ports are available

And finally we have this cozy place to feature a listing of all additional contributors. The list is gathered from the "Author" tag in any addon (plugin, effect, module) you have installed and weighted by the number of their occurrences. So if you feel your name is missing or not high enough on the list you know what to do.. 

Patch On!
