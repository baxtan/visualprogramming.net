Nice but every time I record it seems to record all the chrome as well as the image.  I get the title bar plus what looks to be the size of a (non-existent) sizing bar around the window in the resulting GIF.  I'm sure I could clip this but it won't parse in Photoshop and Krita seems to write the file incorrectly.  This is for a DX renderer in VVVV.  May work fine with other apps - dunno.  Haven't tried.
