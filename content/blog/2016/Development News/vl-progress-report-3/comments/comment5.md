@sebl sure, that will come at some point and rather sooner than later. exploring VL by help patches is of course a nice way to learn it.

but there is another point to consider, the amount of nodes in VL will very quickly exceed the amount of vvvv nodes. providing a help patch for every node will become a monster task, so i guess we will see more 'girlpower' style patches that explain how to work with a set of nodes rather than help patches for every single node.
