Thanks! After a lot of testing, debugging and problem-hunting we got everything running here with tcpsender / receiver and the DX11-nodes of spout.

Important to know:

1. For some reason the TCPSender / Receiver seems to be picky with ip-adresses. Always use fixed ones.

2. If you have two graphics cards in your PC / laptop, make sure, that you assign the proper graphic-card (in our case the NVIDIA-Card via NVIDIA Control Panel) to the TCPSpout Sender AND Receiver. Otherwise it will simply not work.

Boom!
