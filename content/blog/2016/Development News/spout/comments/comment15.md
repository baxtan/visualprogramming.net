/hey ya
Im trying out vvvv with smode (http://smode.fr/) sending out from vvvv with spout to smode. 
something is highly fishy,\ 
smode does not receive vvvv it complains that "unsupported texture format", another funky thing is that I can see on the smode GPU memory meter how the memory is getting eaten up reaches 2.8G with nothing else open but vvvv sending a colorful box to smode. I have no problem sending spout out from Touch designer and receiving in smode, only vvvv acts out. why? (tested with latest alpha, dx9 and dx11). vvvv can send on dx9 and dx11 internally no problem...
