great job! dx9 wokring ist working like a charm. also the tcpversion. MAGIC! 

but can't find the dx11 version. and since the dx11todx9 seems not to work in the latest alphas there is no way to send dx11-texture via network, even not with this dx11todx9-hack. 

where can i find the dx11 version of the spoutsender?
