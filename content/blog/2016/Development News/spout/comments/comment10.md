Hi folks! First of all, thank you! It's a great node!
If any help, I'll tell you my experience.
I've tested it with the demo patch and some other patches of my own. 
I've noticed that, When I have focus on any window but VVVV the output is not that smooth, like it's dropping some frames, but, when I give focus to vvvv window, it runs smoothly.
Besides that, it seems that there is like a random frame-drop from time to time (lets say each few seconds), I may have a messy patch, but when using the old FFGL dll never showed this problem.

Anyway, cheers for such a great node!
