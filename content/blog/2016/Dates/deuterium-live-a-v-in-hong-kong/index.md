MOTORSAW aka Sune Petersen ({{< user "sunep)" >}} DEUTERIUM audiovisual live performance.

DEUTERIUM is a live improvised AV-performance where video is generated live with digital video feedback. The resulting image is then sampled and translated straight into audio. This flips the usual relationship between audio and visuals. This way audio is directly reflecting the image. For this performance MOTORSAW has developed an instrument that allows for live improvisation and exploration of the expression and relation between audio and video.
