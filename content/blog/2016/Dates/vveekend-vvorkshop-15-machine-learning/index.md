This vveekend we will dive deeper into the topic of machine learning and show you some examples of doing classification tasks from inside VVVV using the MachineLearning pack. Machine Learning can be supportive for your work in many different ways, especially for recognizing stuff from data automatically. This can speedup many creative processes as you don't have to spend hours to get to know your data but just let the computer do the work for you.

Some theoretical background of what is actually happening here inside will be provided along on the way and help you to get a deeper understanding of the idea of where Machine Learning can actually be useful for you.

Join us at 5PM CEST tomorrow (Sunday, 1st May) at
