VVVV will be present at resonate again. There'll be several workshops:
---
Elias Holzer and Sebastian Gregor doing a 3day workshop:
[Next Generation Visual Programming with VL](http://resonate.io/2016/education/next-generation-visual-programming-with-vl/) 
We'll try to identify the sort of problems that can be tackled best with VL and show how to use VL within vvvv.
(Parobrod, 11th-13th April, 10AM-6PM Daily)
---
Elliot Woods doing a 1day workshop:
[Projection Mapping on People](http://resonate.io/2016/education/projection-mapping-on-people/) 
This workshop will introduce methods for projecting onto dancers, actors, or your audience.
