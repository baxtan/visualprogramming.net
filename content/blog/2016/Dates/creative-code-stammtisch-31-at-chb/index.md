*The Creative Code Stammtisch is an open conversation between artists, makers, designers, coders, performers, learners and anyone interested in the use of computing skills for artistic expression. The event is free and open to all, regardless of age, origin, gender or experience. Beginners and first-timers should feel especially welcome!*
