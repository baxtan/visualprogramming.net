![Vilhelm scan](P1130046.jpg)

Vilhelm performs a prenatal concert in collaboration with mom and dad

A new human being is on its way to the world. The new person is very close to being ready to enter the world and can already be felt and heard if you listen in the right way.

To celebrate his pending arrival and future ability to see and hear the World without it being filtered by mums belly, Vilhelm is making a little concert.

Vilhelm already has a very active heart that beats around 135 times per minute. Through the use of a fetal doppler ultrasound probe it is possible to hear the heart and other sounds from the womb. These sounds are manipulated to create interesting soundscapes all while being able to hear them as clearly as we can capture them.

There are in total 4 concerts
