Hi there...
living in geneva, i'm quite surprised that a post for this false mapping festival is related in vvvv users. from years they avoid any use of vvvv and decline any vvvv artists as they sell their own software. 
overall from the years i've been present in this festival, i'm still wondering why they call this festival mapping, as it is only a contemporary art show. Last year I've been looking for a mapping show that never founded.
Idon't think this festival is relevant to vvvv community.
thanks
