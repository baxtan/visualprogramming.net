Horray,

we've been invited to join this years [Mapping Festival](http://2016.mappingfestival.com) in Geneva where we'll be doing a full day [projectionmapping masterclass](http://2016.mappingfestival.com/workshops/vvvv-masterclass). as i understood access to that will be free for everyone. we'll demo different techniques all day long and hope to get anyone who is interested in mapping with vvvv involved.

i see also see [Paul Prudence](http://2016.mappingfestival.com/artists/paul-prudence) who usually comes with some vvvv in his bag if i'm not mistaken..

verymuch looking forward to this and hope to see some of you there!
