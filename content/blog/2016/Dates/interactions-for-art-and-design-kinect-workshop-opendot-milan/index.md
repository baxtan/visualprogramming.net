During the workshop we will investigate the potential of Kinect’s sensors used by artists and designers. These sensors allow us to develop a whole range of unexpected, contactless interaction solutions, both for public and private spaces. 

We will explore technical principles behind Kinect and other depth sensors, comparing alternative solutions and trying different revolutionary applications of this affordable device: from 3D scanning to special effects, from gesture recognition to custom tracking solutions, including a virtual reality experience with Oculus. 

Yet, we will take a close look behind the scenes of successful interactive installations that use depth cameras; in order to demonstrate these possibilities we will use the VVVV environment (however a previous knowledge of this tool is not mandatory). 

During the workshop, recommended to designers, artists and developers, we will prototype together a simple interactive installation. 
(Please, bring your own laptop, ideally a PC or Mac with Bootcamp, and the Kinect sensor, install VVVV in advance if you can.)


Workshop is led by Andrej Boleslavský <http://id144.org>
