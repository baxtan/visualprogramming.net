helo again, 

i'm happy to announce the following workshop that i'll be hosting at San Francisco's Gray Area. it will be 9 hours streched over 3 days and the idea is to give an easy introduction to vvvv alongside an introduction to projection mapping techniques. so if you've been interested in either or even both, this workshop is for you:

{{< box >}}
In this 3 part workshop we'll cover various topics and techniques relevant for projection mapping.

After a quick general introduction to the wide range of use cases vvvv covers, we'll explore different features of vvvv that help with the creation of custom tools for interactive content creation and mapping.

We'll cover topics like video effects and compositing, homography based mapping, re-projection based mapping, projector calibration, working with point and curve-editors for animation and more. Bring your questions and ideas and we'll elaborate on those as our time permits.

Enrollment for this workshop is $270 ($30 per hour x 9){{< /box >}}

hope to see some of you there!
