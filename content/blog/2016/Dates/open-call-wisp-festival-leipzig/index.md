The „Wisp – Festival for Digital Arts“, from 18th - 20th of November in Leipzig, welcomes submissions on this year`s theme „The stranger within us“.

Under the theme "The stranger within us", based on a lecture of the german psychoanalyst Arno Gruen in 2009, the exhibition will invite the guests to experience several interactive artworks from international artists with all senses and to reflect the loss of empathy in our society with the consequently personal and political consequences.

You are welcome to submit media art projects, installations/sculptures, video-art and performance art works, according to the theme of the festival and/or to share your knowledge about a special hardware/software tool and/or working techniques with it.
