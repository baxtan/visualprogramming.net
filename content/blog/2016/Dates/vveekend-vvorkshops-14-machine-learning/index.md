The Machine Learning pack brings all the neural network craze which blows the IT world currently into vvvv. And if you want to get started in that topic join us on 23rd April 17:00 CEST. This workshop will be a more theoretical one building the foundation for the following one where we will learn how that theory is applied in vvvv.
