Good news evvvvryone! vveekend vvorkshops is returning on the weekend of 19th-20th November with 2 workshops! 1st will be about {{< contribution "md.ecosystem.mp" "md.ecosystem" >}} packs: what has changed over the one year (and it's quite a long list ;) ), and for the main attraction {{< user "digitalwannabe" >}} will show us his new and powerful pack: {{< contribution "d.o.p.e" "D.O.P.E." >}}. It turns out we're almost neighbours (he lives in Vienna and I live in Budapest) so we can be in the same space, no remote desktop shenanigan!
