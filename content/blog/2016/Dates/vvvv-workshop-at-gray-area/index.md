helo bayarea people,

i'm coming to the beautiful [Gray Area](http://grayarea.org) in april to host a vvvv workshop on the 11th, 13th and 15th from 6pm to 9pm each day. i am not sure yet how to target the workshop thats why i am hoping to get feedback from some of you who might be interested to join. shall we rather do a beginners course or focus on a specific topic? projection mapping? dx11? you name it and i'll do my best to teach you all i know about it. or do we even get enough people interested a [VL](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/vl.html) workshop?

please make yourself heard in the comments and pass this link on to potentially interested people. 

also i'm going to speak at the http://grayareafestival.io and do a 3h introductory workshop to vvvv there. i'll announce that in an extra post once their website is up with all the info.

verymuch looking forward to this,
joreg.
