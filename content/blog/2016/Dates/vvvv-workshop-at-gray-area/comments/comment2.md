I grew up in Bay area, but for the past decade I'm in the UK 'the truly gray area' 

One more interesting tip, I don't know if you heard of CNMAT http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/

CNMAT, Similar to IRCAM in Paris, are the pioneers of sound synthesis (early MAX/MSP stuff, also they invented OSC and many more) I studied there for a while in late 90s and their location is in an awesome villa near the university. Occasionally they have small venue concerts and interesting lectures http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/events. I know the director Prof. Edmund Campion, depending on your schedule if you want to do another mini vvvv workshop in the UCB setting, as CNMAT would be a great venue for it; Contact Ed Campion http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/people/edmund_campion (he was my supervisor over 10 years ago, you can tell him amir soltani suggested it)
If tonfilm is going with you guys, you have to visit CNMAT if you can :)

I love SF Bay Area, there is so much to do, Check out the free classified ad paper call East Bay Express for all the cool clubs and events listings. Also if you call KALX station (they are in the basement of Barrows Hall, UCB) and give the detail of your workshops they could announce it on the FM radio, perhaps even have a live interview about vvvv!
