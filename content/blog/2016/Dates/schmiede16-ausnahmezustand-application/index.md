Every year in late September an [abandoned industrial salt refinery](http://schmiede.ca/location/) on an island in Hallein, Austria opens up to around 300 Smiths and their ideas. We physically gather in order to get inspired, network, create, present and share. Schmiede provides a basic cooperative prototyping environment and an infrastructure full of impulses and passionate people.

- Do you have a project in mind, but don't have the space, people or tools to realize it?
- Do you want to take time to develop yourself and your projects engulfed in a large group of peers?
- Do you want to meet like minded creatives to collaborate, exchange ideas or just get inspired?
- Do you want to present your project or idea in front of your peers and get feedback?

Then Schmiede is the right place for you:
