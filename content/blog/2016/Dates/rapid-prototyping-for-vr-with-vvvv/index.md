A detailed workshop on the possibilities of vvvv for creating VR experiences. Within the # Immersed Narratives track of the Retune Festival 2016 in Berlin.

Workshop Contents:

While you are fresh in the morning, we'll start with a condensed ~1h presentation that gives you a comprehensive overview of the current VR hype, including:
- available hardware and platforms and how they compare
- technical challenges
- emerging standards of software and interaction design
- software development challenges
Then we'll have a look at a few popular VR experiences to see what they do right and we'll discuss the different concepts.
After this inspirational part we will learn how fast and easy it is to setup a simple 3D VR scene with vvvv's OpenVR pack and develop a quick prototype of a VR experience in real-time. Here you can come up with your own ideas or we find a little project everyone likes. Due to limited hardware access we will work in small teams of about 2-5 people.

During the workshop me, {{< user "joreg" >}} and {{< user "dominikKoller" >}} will be there to assist you in case of patch emergencies.
