Hi everybody,
We decided to give a vvvvorkshop to spread the love.
This first session will be aimed at absolute beginners - no previous knowledge needed.
We will guide you through the vvvv interface and explain basic concepts like quads, spreads and transformations. In the end we should end up with some nice real time animations and all the stuff to get you started with vvvv.

What do you need to bring?

* Windows laptop running vvvv
* Please Install the latest version of vvvv and the addon pack.

* If you encounter any problems installing vvvv please contact us before the workshop
* ( It’s fine to share a machine with two people, this is a good way to learn. )
* 3 Button Mouse

There will be a fee of 15,00 € per attendee to pay for the room, we are booking for this workshop.
