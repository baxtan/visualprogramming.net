*Click, click, click,... VL in action*

On short notice,

anyone at [Ars Electronica](http://www.aec.at/radicalatoms) this year up for learning something new? I'll be doing a 4h introduction to [VL](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/vl.html).

### What the VL?
VL is our next-generation visual programming language that combines dataflow with features known from object-oriented programming. Language features include but are not limited to:
<!--{SPLIT()}-->
- datatypes and operations
- loops
- delegates
<!--~~~-->
- generics
- observables
- interfaces
<!--{SPLIT}-->
As a proof of concept VL is now embedded into vvvv before it will later be available in a standalone development environment. In the workshop you'll learn how you can take your patching skills to the next level using the new features that distinguish VL from vvvv.

### Workshop Requirements:
* Know your [vvvv basics](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/learning/tutorials/index.html)
* Bring your windows laptop with the latest [vvvv alpha](https://vvvv.org/downloads/previews) installed and running, if you want to patch along

Starts at 11h sharp, limited seats, first come first served. No festival ticket needed, just show up eager to learn and patient with alpha-grade software.

Know of any other vvvv related things during the festvial? Let us know in the comments. Looking forward to this very much!
