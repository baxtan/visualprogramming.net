Two full packed days of vvvv based Immersion will empower you to have a basic grasp for the fulldome medium. 

{{< user "velcrome" >}} will guide you through basic concepts of realtime dome projection. The workshop will be touching on common workflows, 3d scene definition, story-telling with audio-reactive environments, and mastering for industry warping and mapping.

The newest version of open source vvvv-Dome will be supplied, so best bring your laptop with a nice version of dx11 enabled vvvv to get a jump start. 

On the third day, [Romain Tardy](http://www.romaintardy.com/) from AntiVJ will take over.

Why?
You know, VR glasses are cool, but at a fundamental level somewhat asocial. It's the Bucky in us that insists, that domes are the actual social VR places. Gotta push both!
