International Contemporary and Video Art festival “Waterpieces” invites to participate in the workshop of a creative video performance / visual instruments under the guidance of  Sune Petersen. The workshop will be held from 18 – 19 August 2016 at floating art center “NOASS”. During the workshop participants will be introduced to vvvv – program for real- time video performance, especially emphasizing development process of graphical video instruments. In addition, participants will be invited to take part in discussion of visualization’s role in context of music, as well as playability and audio synchronisation. The workshop will prepare the participants for a simple performance in connection to the workshop.

Visual instruments are instruments made using software that generates video as output. Instruments can be played and if you are skilled and a bit lucky you can make instruments that are easy to use and with time you can begin to master the instrument.

VVVV is a hybrid visual/textual live-programming environment for easy prototyping and development. It is designed to facilitate the handling of large media environments with physical interfaces, real-time motion graphics, audio and video that can interact with many users simultaneously. Responsible for its development is the VVVV group ([/impressum](https://vvvv.org/impressum)).

VVVV is free for non-commercial use,commercial use requires a license.

During the workshop, we will touch upon these subjects:

VVVV basics
Generating simple graphics, 2D, 3D
Video Feedback
Image processing
Playing back video
Interfacing to controllers MIDI/HID
If the participants wish so, the workshop can also cover controlling vvvv (or lots of other “VJ” softwares) from a Music sequencer
Requirements:

Windows computer with latest version of vvvv installed along with the current addon pack and the current DX11 pack. (Get it here: [/downloads](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads) and here: {{< contribution "directx11-nodes-alpha)" >}}
Basic understanding of 3D Math is an advantage but not a requirement
A MIDI or HID game controller are recommended to enable tactile control of the instrument
Sune Petersen (born in 1974 in Denmark) is an international VJ and digital artist who works with synthetic video in performance and installations. He has studied physics and computer engineering and through the past years Sune Petersen has worked with Aalborg university faculty of Architecture and Design and other institutions teaching at workshops where interactive installations have been on the agenda. His working area also includes visualisations, photography, audio and teaching but one of Sune’s main interests is live visual performance. Some of Peterson’s best know works are NoRA Pavillion at La Biennale 2006 (Venice) and world’s first interactive bench („Playful bench”) that invites you to play, move and experience the urban space in a new way.

Creative programming platform V4wednesday.com has said: „Sune’s work tends to have more noise, more texture, more soul and more subtle control than most VJ sets you’ll come across, whatever the software.”
