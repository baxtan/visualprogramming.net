correction: the workshop will be tomorrow on sunday, the 24th around 18h CEST.

we'll start diving into machine learning by using the kinect2 gesture builder by microsoft an will use {{< user "vux" >}}'s kinect gesture nodes. i'll explain how to apply them to your applications and on the way give you some theoretical basics of the technology behind this magic.

we'll have a look at the machine learning pack in the following workshop which will probably happen the following weekend.

looking forward to see you!
