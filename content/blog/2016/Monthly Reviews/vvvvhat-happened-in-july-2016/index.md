hallihallo,

time flies and i am glad another month has just started which gives us a break to look back at all the things that happened recently. it's been a lot, check this:

there were some small updates on our own behalf:
* [How TUIO do?](/blog/2016/how-tuio-do) announcing better TUIO support 
* [a new GIF Recorder](/blog/2016/introducing-the-rekorder)
* a fix for the new [Spout](/blog/2016/spout-0) nodes

## Contributions

then just last week {{< user "digitalwannabe" >}} went on a rampage releasing two powerful plugins:
* {{< contribution "TetGen" >}} - a Quality Tetrahedral Mesh Generator and a 3D Delaunay Triangulator
* {{< contribution "Triangle" >}} - a 2d Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator
and immediately {{< user "microdee" >}} jumped at it and teased us with [taking this to the next dimension](/blog/triangledx11-renderer).

*Triangle in a 1 minute help-patch action*

but not to oversee in that tumult {{< user "RobertQue" >}} shared his first contribution, a module to control the {{< contribution "pioneer-pro-dj-link-rekordbox-only" "Pioneer PRO DJ LINK" >}}. 

further we got some fixes/improvements to existing contributions:
* {{< user "microdee" >}} and {{< user "sebl" >}} were so kind as to finally provide us with the long awaited x64 build of the popular {{< contribution "vvvv.packs.image" >}}
* microdee also updated his {{< contribution "vpm-alpha" >}}
* {{< user "everyoneishappy" >}} released an update to his tasty [instance noodels](/blog/instance-noodles-update-alpha-0.3-tonkotsu), now supporting constructive solid geometry...divine..
* also he fixed {{< contribution "softshadows" >}} to work again with latest dx11 

and again it seems {{< user "u7angel" >}} has something [brewing in his laboratories](/blog/texture-to-gif-frankenstein).

boooom..let that all sink for a while...then:

## Gallery

{{< vimeo "173679093" >}}
*Hypnotic: 'Terra Nullius' by {{< user "Patxi7" >}}*

various gems:
* {{< user "ggml" >}} dropped [his updated resume](http://cote.ggml.ro)
* {{< user "featherfurl" >}} has [a tumbler full of vvvvame](http://featherfurl.tumblr.com/tagged/vvvv)
* {{< user "martincoyne" >}} wrote an article about the vvvv- and related communities: [children-of-io](/blog/2016/children-of-io)
* {{< user "velcrome" >}} added the documentation for their [cupola-projection](/blog/cupola-projection)
* {{< user "Luper" >}} shows us his: [led-bars-controlled-with-vvvv](/blog/led-bars-controlled-with-vvvv)

Ars Electronica has setup two exhibitions including works by vvvv users:
* [Earh Lab](http://export.aec.at/earthlab/) in moscow is featuring {{< user "ain" >}}. open until end of september.
* at a [carmaker's showroom](http://www.drive-volkswagen-group.com/en/exhibitions.html) in berlin they are featuring quayola's [captives](http://www.quayola.com/captives-1/) which he did in collaboration with {{< user "vux" >}} and {{< user "dottore" >}}. open until august 27, free admission. 

and berliners listen up:
{{< user "rrrr" >}} will be performing at the upcoming [Berlin Atonal 2016](http://www.berlin-atonal.com/atonal-2016/) festival. i cannot set a link to his works on the website(!), so please help yourself looking for "Rainer Kohlberger". see you there...

## what the VL?
