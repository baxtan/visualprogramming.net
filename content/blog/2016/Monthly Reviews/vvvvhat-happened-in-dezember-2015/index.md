## Oldies but goldies
working with QRCodes? yes there is {{< node "QRCode (EX9.Texture)" >}} to create QRCodes but how about reading them? well, already two years ago {{< user "kiilo" >}} provided a {{< contribution "zxing-qrcode-reader" "QRCode Reader" >}} he based on the great [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) library. sources included. very handy! 

## Gallery
always good for a surprise this {{< user "tekcor" >}} guy. if i am not mistaken he claims this video to be made entirely with vvvv. chapeau for the unique style: 
{{< vimeo "149366172" >}}

also worth mentioning this latest work by [refik anadol](http://www.refikanadol.com) which features some vvvv: [Virtual Depictions: San Francisco](https://vvvv.org/blog/virtual-depictions-san-francisco-public-art-project) comes with some more details in [this article on creativeapplications](http://www.creativeapplications.net/vvvv/virtual-depictions-san-francisco-cinematic-data-driven-sculpture/).
![](Virtual-Depictions-011.jpg) 

and while on that site i spotted at least three projects among the [10 most memorable projects of 2015](http://www.creativeapplications.net/featured/10-most-memorable-projects-of-2015/) realized with vvvv:

[Satelliten](http://www.creativeapplications.net/arduino-2/satelliten-a-machine-tracking-activities-in-lower-earth-orbit/):
![](IMGP7999_bear2_small.jpg) 

[In the Eyes of the Animal – Marshmallow Laser Feast](http://www.creativeapplications.net/maxmsp/in-the-eyes-of-the-animal-mlf-virtualise-a-forest-through-the-eyes-of-its-creatures/):
![](In-the-Eyes-of-the-Animal-Screens_08-1600x1000.jpg) 

[483 Lines – Projecting analogue video picture on 483 nylon threads](http://www.creativeapplications.net/openframeworks/483-lines-projecting-analogue-video-picture-on-483-nylon-threads/):
![](483lines2.jpg) 

and remember the guy who did the {{< contribution "wrapped-in-code" "smooth cloth animation" >}} for node15? i found him on instagram:
* https://www.instagram.com/michael_theman/

## Education
{{< user "microdee" >}} is really meaning it. he continued his series of vveekendvvorkshops nearly every week. even had some guest lecturers over. what a great idea and realization. now everybody go and click the flattr button on his userpage to show your support. if you want! no pressure. OR you go to the [vveekendvvorkshops page on patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vveekendvvorkshops) and show your appreciation there. either way is fine.

if you're not convinced yet just follow the [vveekendvvorkshops youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8Vqigdbq5Gam_6dcGdNBw) for a start. 

## VL
and of course VL our next-generation visual programming language is in active development and did some nice steps forward as you can read in the devvvv blog:
