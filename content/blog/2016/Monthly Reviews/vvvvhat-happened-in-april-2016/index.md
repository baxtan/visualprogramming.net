## Gallery

now this is how you make and document a project. only he forgot to upload it to our gallery, so i'm afraid only 90 out of 100 points. it apparently was a bachelor thesis by thomas mayer at the [Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch Gmünd](http://www.hfg-gmuend.de/en/)). more details [on his website](http://thomas-mayer.de/portfolio/table-tennis-trainer).
{{< vimeo "161672022" >}}

* {{< user "evvvvil" >}} has a new [Kinect Dance Hack](https://vimeo.com/152218180) out
* {{< user "boplbopl" >}} has [a new set on flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/boplbopl/sets/72157667174398656)

...and {{< user "zeos" >}} is telling us how he goes [about his work](https://vimeo.com/160707634).

## Oldies but Goldies

i've been recently reminded of this little gem by [Grosse8](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/grosse8):
{{< vimeo "55024483" >}}

but also i want to make sure that everyone is aware of [Spout](http://spout.zeal.co). available now for at least 2 years it allows you to share dx9/dx11/opengl textures between different programs on windows, like: max/msp, touchdesigner, resolume, afterfx,... see a full list of supported programs on their website.

latest vvvv alphas come with ready to use modules: Spout (DX9 Sender) and Spout (DX9 Receiver)!

## what the VL?

about a year ago [we boldly demoed VL](https://vimeo.com/129085756). and now it still hasn't made it out of alpha. zzzz. wherever we show it, people who get it, get it very quickly. and they can't wait to getting handson with it. but we're still a bit cautious in recommending to use it, because we're just not there yet to allow everyone have a great initial experience. so please use it already if you're bravvvve but still wait if you like things a little more polished. latest news are always here: [/vl](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/vl.html)

{{< user "gregsn" >}}, {{< user "azeno" >}} and {{< user "dominikkoller" >}} just came back from a 3 day workshop at this years resonate festival. [their report](/blog/2016/resonate-report) comes with a link to the github repository that has the game they created with the participants.
