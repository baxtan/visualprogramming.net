thank you joreg for the monthly summary, the work is appreciated !

concerning...

{{< box >}}quote:joreg:
many people are using vvvv for commercial work, which is great. only hardly anyone seems to bother posting their work in the gallery. because of course everyone is too busy. never mind, leaves more space for the arts{{< /box >}}

if i may speak for myself, the gallery is still not appealing. it's still this big pile of posts where everything gets lost.

a "simple" layout change would help i.e grid view. maybe some highlight projects being slightly larger. i mean you start to curate in these monthly blog posts, why not in the gallery too. would make the pile more entertaining.
