ich sag einfach helo again,

another month has passed and with the following lines i want to wrap up the vvvv-jannuary for you.

## Contributions

you may have noticed recently that the download-counters for contributions are broken. we're aware of that and are only waiting for our web-admin to have time to fix that. anyway, again we've all been presented with a few goodies last month:
* grandmaster {{< user "woei" >}} gives us {{< contribution "scripter-%28csharp%29" "Scripter (c#" >}}) for which he also added an extra [introduction](/blog/2016/introducing-scripter)
* {{< user "Martin Zrcek" >}} has uploaded {{< contribution "martins-toolkit" "Martins Toolkit" >}} and {{< contribution "project-templates" "Project Templates" >}} for which he asks for your feedback
* {{< user "agolloch21" >}} shared his {{< contribution "sina-weibo-plugin" "Sina Weibo plugin" >}}

## Oldies but goldies

not the cleanest contribution i must say (in fact {{< user "beyon" >}} warns us about it in the description) but still better than nothing and a good starting-point if you need to read the content of a midi-file all at once: {{< contribution "midi-file-reader" "Midi File Reader" >}}

## Gallery

apparently this is a 2 years old bachelor thesis project for the Information Design program at [FH JOANNEUM](http://www.fh-joanneum.at/) (Graz, Austria) by Stefan Kernjak. still impressive:
{{< vimeo "76971295" >}}

then i found [schnellebuntebilder](http://schnellebuntebilder.de) and [klingklangklong](http://klingklangklong.de) in a report [on arte tv](http://cinema.arte.tv/de/artikel/zoom-kinect) demoing one of their collaborative works.

[IntoLight](http://intolight.de) produced an [advertisment](http://www.intolight.de/en/projects/dx11pointcloud) for their {{< contribution "dx11.pointcloud" "DX11.PointCloud contribution" >}}.

and it seems vvvv [has been discovered](http://www.netural.com/allgemein/interaktive-live-performance-das-publikum-macht-mit/) by [Netural](http://netural.at).

## Education

{{< user "microdee" >}} organized two more vveekend vvorkshops on the topics "Emeshe", which he did himself and "Everything DMX" which was presented by {{< user "vjc4" >}}. as usual you can watch them in the [vveekend vvorkshops youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8Vqigdbq5Gam_6dcGdNBw).

and i don't understand a lot of what's going on here but it seems to be a good thing (if you're japanese): http://vvvv-jp.tumblr.com

## Blogs

{{< user "mrboni" >}} asked in the shoutbox about blogs reporting about the world of digital arts and i thought it would be good to again list what we found:
* http://s-v-m.tumblr.com/
* http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/
* http://we-make-money-not-art.com/
* http://creativeapplications.net/
* http://createdigitalmusic.com/
anyone got any more stuff like those?

## in eigener sache

it always takes me ages to figure out all the details and put them into some prose. don't let this go to waste and please take your time and read [vvvv in numbers 2015](/blog/2016/vvvv-in-numbers-2015). 

also {{< user "robotanton" >}} has recently updated the main documentation section on everything you need to know about [patching](/blog/2016/know-your-patches) and [boygrouping](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/boygrouping/index.html). i am sure most of you can find something new in there..
