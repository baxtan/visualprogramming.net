winter's come to an end but still apparently everyone was very busy vvvvinging away, because here is what we got this time:

## Contributions

two completely new addons:
* {{< contribution "intel-realsense-plugin" "Intel RealSense Plugin" >}} by {{< user "aoi" >}} allows to interface with Realsense devices
* {{< contribution "engravvvver" "Engravvvver" >}} by {{< user "LaserLars" >}} rasters images to G-Code

and a couple of updates:
* {{< contribution "shadertoy-renderer" >}} by {{< user "mino" >}} updated with a dx11 version
* {{< contribution "fog-from-depthbuffer-dx11" >}} with a fix by {{< user "tonfilm" >}}
* {{< contribution "polar-coordinates" >}} with a dx11 version by {{< user "colorsound" >}}
* {{< contribution "spatial-edge-blend-shader" >}} with new stuff by {{< user "colorsound" >}}

## Gallery

[SOMAPHONY](http://somaphonics.com/) an audiovisual composition by {{< user "zeos" >}} performed by Katharina KÃ¶ller:

{{< vimeo "157440677" >}}

Also [the two won a prize](http://schmiede.tumblr.com/post/141191920767/10ve-won-see-the-world-2) with their 10ve installation we saw at NODE15.

There is a new [000.graphics showrweel](/blog/000.graphics-showreel) by {{< user "tekcor" >}}. And don't miss the [Digital Forest Dome](/blog/digital-forest-dome) documentation about a recent project by {{< user "colorsound" >}} and {{< user "aka-visuals" >}} and the [Interactive dance show with crowd genereated stickman](/blog/interactive-dance-show-with-crowd-generated-stickmen) documentation about a recent project by {{< user "zepi" >}}.

Meso added two documentations about two of their last years projects to vimeo: [BMW Carbon Core - IAA 2015](/blog/meso-bmw-carbon-core-iaa-2015) and [BMW Plugin-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle - IAA 2015](/blog/meso-bmw-plug-in-hybrid-electric-vehicle-iaa-2015).

Here is a list of flickr users who recently added some of their stuff to the vvvv group:

## Education

{{< user "microdee" >}} is unstoppable. he organized and streamed another 2 workshops. one with {{< user "vux" >}} on how to write DX11 Plugins, the other with some of his friends on integrating LambdaCube (a functional gpu-language)) with vvvv. see them and all the previous ones on the [vveekend vvorkshops youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8Vqigdbq5Gam_6dcGdNBw).

if you're keen on meeting other patchers in person have a look at these [creative coding meetups around the world](http://www.meetup.com/find/?allMeetups=false&keywords=vvvv&radius=Infinity). i can specifically recommend [the berlin one](http://www.meetup.com/creativeCodeBerlin/) which i've enjoyed myself some of already..
