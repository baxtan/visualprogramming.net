Our own stuff first: we released a new set of Arduino nodes, redesigned together with {{< user "jens.a.e" >}} and completely patched in VL, see [Arduino Second Service](/blog/2016/arduino-second-service).

If Mrs. Krenz thinks she gets away with this, without doing a related workshop at node17 she has cut herself (traditional austrian saying). More beauty on <http://frau-krenz.de/folding-patterns>
