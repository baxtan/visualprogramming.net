helo helo,

so there year is coming to an end and it feels we're only getting started...with beta35 being scheduled for a release soonâ„¢ we have a bughunt running at the moment where you can win one of 2 lattepandas. there are not too many reports in yet, so your chances are still very high to win. for all details please see: [Find a Bug, win a Panda (latte](/blog/find-a-bug-win-a-panda-%28latte%29)).

Now check out the completely new **[NODE website](https://nodeforum.org/)** with the **NODE17 announcement** and save that date!

And then have a look at the fancy new [About Dialog](/blog/2016/alt-a) we spent beta35 before checking out what more happened last month:

## Contributions
![](superphong.png) 
One shiny new {{< contribution "Superphong" >}} by shadermaster {{< user "mburk" >}}

## Teasers
Again we have a couple of teasers, that is screenshots of crazy things that hopefully at some point will become available for everyone..
{{< user "microdee" >}} did a proper blogpost: [meanwhile-at-microdees-lab-rectpack](/blog/2016/meanwhile-at-microdees-lab-rectpack) while others just posed around:
* [vvvv-telegram](/blog/vvvv-telegram)
* [imagemagick-%28imagemagick%29-help](/blog/imagemagick-%28imagemagick%29-help)
* [realtime-blender-to-vvvv](/blog/realtime-blender-to-vvvv)

## Education
{{< user "microdee" >}} continued his series of vveekend vvorkshops with two episodes that are ready for you to watch:
* update on the improvements of his very own md.ecosystem packs
* {{< user "digitalwannabe" >}} introducing his new pack D.O.P.E. for distorting geometry

To watch those or any of the past workshops head over to the [vveekend vvorkshop youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8Vqigdbq5Gam_6dcGdNBw).

## What the VL?
Going prettey good. With the feature-freeze in place we're now mostly fixing the buggers we get in via the [bughunt](/blog/find-a-bug-win-a-panda-%28latte%29) and the ones we're still aware of. Also we're now doing a first round of ui-performance tweaks in order to make it a bit more pleasent to work with. Also the networking (udp, tcp) core-library is getting in shape and research is underway regarding all things async..

Read our two recent progress reports here:
* [VL: Progress Report /2](/blog/2016/vl-progress-report-2)
* [VL: Progress Report /3](/blog/2016/vl-progress-report-3)

And then as promised the first batch of additions to the core-library we've been working on together with {{< user "woei" >}}: [File IO](/blog/2016/let-me-present-to-you-file-io). Still oh so much more to come...
