Hello Summer Season!

We are excited to announce that the [NODE Institute](https://thenodeinstitute.org/summer-season-23/) is running a [vvvv beginners course](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/vvvv-beginner-class-summer-2023/) as well as a range of intermediate/advanced sessions. We welcome members of the community to join us by proposing or requesting specific workshops. Now we would löike to hear from you!

* **What workshops do you want to attend?**
* **What workshops can you offer to host?**

Don't be afraid to mention "too simple" or "too crazy" topics. Everything is possible at this stage. As always we're planning to offer a wide range of workshops covering introductory to hardcore topics and we need to hear from you so we can best cover your needs.

Feel free to request/propose as many workshops as you like. Only before you do so please check if there is already a similar request/proposal and consider adding to that existing discussion rather than starting a new topic. Discussing entries is very much encouraged hoping that it can help us all to better define individual proposals/requests.

Then for both requests and proposals use the like-button of the topic to show your interest in it. We will then look at the discussions and like-counts to get an idea of what's hot and what's not.

### For details on how to contribute please read

* **[Request a workshop](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/node-workshops-23/requests)**
* **[Propose a workshop](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/node-workshops-23/proposals)**

Please note that a proposal doesn’t guarantee a spot in the season! The NODE Institute will evaluate all proposals and include those, they see fit.

Workshops will take place online every Thursday, starting from April 2023. For the exact schedule, we’ll get in touch with you once we have accepted your proposal.
