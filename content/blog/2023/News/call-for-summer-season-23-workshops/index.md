To all vvvv learners and teachers!

We are happy to announce that [The NODE Institute](https://thenodeinstitute.org/summer-season-23/) is running a **[vvvv beginners course](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/vvvv-beginner-class-summer-2023/) starting on April 17th** as well as a range of intermediate/advanced sessions. This is to announce a call for workshops. Here is what we'd like to hear from you:

* **What workshops do you want to attend?**
* **What workshops can you offer to host?**

Don't be afraid to mention "too simple" or "too crazy" topics. Everything is possible at this stage. We're planning to offer a wide range of workshops covering introductory to hardcore topics and we need to hear from you so we can best cover your needs.

Feel free to request/propose as many workshops as you like. Only before you do so please check if there is already a similar request/proposal and consider adding to that existing discussion rather than starting a new topic. Discussing entries is very much encouraged hoping that it can help us all to better define individual proposals/requests.

Then for both requests and proposals use the like-button of the topic to show your interest in it. We will then look at the discussions and like-counts to get an idea of what's hot and what's not.

### Your contribution

For details on how to request/propose a workshop, read the following:

* **[Request a workshop](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/how-to-request-a-workshop/21317)**
* **[Propose a workshop](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/how-to-propose-a-workshop/21316)**

Please note that a proposal doesn’t guarantee that your workshop will be running this season! The NODE Institute will evaluate all proposals and include those, they see fit.

Workshops will take place online **every Thursday, 6pm CET**, starting from April 2023. For the exact schedule, we’ll get in touch with you once we have accepted your proposal.

### What's in it for you
Here is what the NODE Institute offers to workshop hosts:

* Full access to all other workshops of the season
* 500€ per 3h workshop that had enough attendees to cover costs

### Deadline
Since we're already quite late with this call, we'll evaluate proposals and assign them to date slots as they come in. Therefore no hard deadline, just add your contributions at your earliest convenience!
