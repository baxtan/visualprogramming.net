Where were we?

Right, we've released another stable this month! If you haven't already, please read all about **vvvv gamma 5.2** in [the changelog](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/5.x.html).

Then: If you're an avid follower of the preview builds you've noticed that we're currently going through some turbulances. The cause of those is a good one though: After 5.2 stable we merged back a bigger branch where work has been going on towards... drumrolls... the long awaited Inspektor! So thanks for reporting all the buggers in recent previews, we'll let you know as soon as there is something to see..

Further, work is currently going on in these areas:
- There'll be a node-set to communicate with a [redis](https://redis.io) database
- Global Channels are getting backends for OSC and redis
- There'll be a node-set for logging messages from your patch to various logging sinks including an improved Log window
- Remember the [Remoter](https://beta.vvvv.org/contributions/misc/remotersa/index.html)? There'll be a node-set and UI to achieve what it did
