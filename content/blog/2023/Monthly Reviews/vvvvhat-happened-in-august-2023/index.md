August is a wrap. Here are the news in brief:

We managed to run another meetup and you can re-watch it here if you haven't yet:

{{< youtube "o5MRTJTyzPc" >}}

Nothing new in the previews yet, but a lot is being worked on. Here some teasers:
- A pack for easy integration with [Augmenta](https://augmenta.tech/) is in the making
- We've started looking into supporting [OSCQuery](https://github.com/Vidvox/OSCQueryProposal)
- Work on a set of nodes for logging based on [MEL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging) is ongoing
- Work continued on allowing to [annotate Compute4 as Color](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/add-feature-to-annotate-computefloat4-as-color/21591) in shaders
- We did initial experiments on adding a boygrouping-like experience to vvvv gamma

And probably a few more things. September will hopefully show some results already...
