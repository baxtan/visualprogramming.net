If you haven't been aware yet:

The third week in a row now, on Thursday evening, The NODE Institute is running one of a series of [vvvv intermediate-level workshops](https://thenodeinstitute.org/ws23-vvvv-intermediates/).

Next on the list, this Thursday December 7, is an [Introduction To FUSE](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ws23-vvvv-03-fuse-introduction/) the clever GPU patching library. It is **free to join** once you are registered at The NODE Institute, so there is really no good excuse to miss it!

Further we're happy to finally have a release out, officially supporting [Augmenta](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/introducing-augmenta/), a plug & play solution tracking people in a room or hands on a wall or table. 

And here some more topics we've been working on lately, so you know what's cooking:
- Latest vvvv gamma 5.3 previews are shipping with VL.Serialization.MessagePack, which adds support for [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) a widely used binary serialization format
- MessagePack is now also the default serialization under the hood of VL.IO.Redis
- Bindings with VL.IO.Redis can now also have an "Expiry" set, allowing them to be auto-deleted after a given time
- Lastet previews are also already shipping with the new Logging system. If you can't await the announcement blog-post, check the helpbrowser for "logging"
- Work on Global Channels and Bindings is ongoing
- We have a branch where we're running on .NET8 already
- We have a branch where we're we can use `ComputeColor` in shaders to get inputs of type `GPU<RGBA>`
- Work is ongoing for adding more features to [VL.Devices.ZED](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Devices.ZED) 
- We're preparing a PR towards Stride, adding support for the [Passthrough](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.0/html/xrspec.html#XR_FB_passthrough) extension for OpenXR
