We did it!

**[vvvv gamma 5.0](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/vvvv-gamma-5.0-release/)** is out and seems well received. Thanks everyone for your lovvvveley feedback, we're really happy to hear it also when things work, not only when they don't work.

If you're still rather new to vvvv gamma, how about taking the [vvvv beginner course](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/vvvv-beginner-class-summer-2023/), starting May 8th, run by chk of [3e8](https://3e8.studio). There isn't any more efficient way to get started with vvvv. To get a taste of chk's teaching style, have a look at his recently released [beginner video tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2KeRstDQVRRVnzCHEambwAI4yWmpIF-p).

If the above course sounds too basic for you, please help yourself to one of the 15! topical workshops, starting this week:

* May 4th: [Creating an App from Scratch](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss23-vvvv-creating-an-app-from-scratch/)
* May 5th: [Transformations and Spaces](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss23-vvvv-02-transformation-and-spaces/)
* May 11th: [Object Oriented Patching](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss23-vvvv-03-object-oriented-patching/)

and [many more](https://thenodeinstitute.org/vvvv-intermediates-summer-2023/) to come.
