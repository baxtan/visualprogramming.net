Summertime,

and the feature-machine is running hot! Last month we dropped two new essential tools in the preview builds that will improve your patching experience:

*Exhibit A: The long awaited error view*

*Exhibit B: The even longer awaited node inspector* 

Beware: Both are still previews, but any feedback is already very welcome!

Further, recent progress was made in the following areas:
- The OSC backend for Global Channels
- The new [Remoter](https://beta.legacy.vvvv.org/contributions/misc/remotersa/index.html) node-set and UI

Also two meetups happened: 
- One in Japan, which you can [read about in this write-up](https://bassdrum.substack.com/p/vvvv-japan-meetup-kyoto-vol1) by Takuma Nakata
- One in Berlin, which you can rewatch below:
