Here we go again!

The upcoming stable release of vvvv gamma is taking ever better shape. Most recently we were finally able to publish the remaining libraries that were still private, as open-source. Read all about this move in: [Introducing VL.Standardlibs](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/introducing-vl.standardlibs/).

Also, after quite some iterations, we're finally happy with the new C# and Shader Wizards. They will save you a lot of clicks going forward. To try them, get the most recent [preview](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download) and see: `Quad Menu > New > ..`

To combat the frustration of "which version of a NuGet to use with which version of vvvv", we're now maintaining a [NuGet Compatibility Chart](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/nuget-compatibility-chart.html). Please help us keep this up-to-date. And yes, the package manager UI is still to come...

Finally a big shout out to [chk](https://mastodon.xyz/@chkworks) for releasing his [VL.ThePatchersGuide](https://github.com/chkworks/VL.ThePatchersGuide), a series of tutorial patches for beginners. This is massive and deserves [your support](https://ko-fi.com/chkworks)!
