Also note: The recordings of the [Sequencing values on a timeline using the Kairos library](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss23-vvvv-sequencing-values-on-a-timeline-using-the-kairos-library) workshop are now available.

If you're looking for other workshops that had previously been announced (including the series on [VL.Fuse](https://www.thefuselab.io/)), rest assured that they are still planned to happen in one form or the other, only at later dates.

Happy patching!
