The 20th edition of our worldwide meetups is almost aligned with the 20th birthday of our beloved vvvv! So, if you did not have a chance yet to celebrate, that's your call! ;)

We’re meeting on **Thursday, January 19th 8pm CET**! The meetup will take place live in Berlin. However, participants can also take part remotely from anywhere in the world.

It is a place to meet and exchange ideas and experiences with other users and the development team.  The meetup is open to anyone who wants to join, no matter if you are a vvvv expert or beginner, a famous or breadless artists, a designhead or technologist, a piano player or techno musician.

We are especially open for newcomers and curious beginners and we try to make this meetup as diverse as possible but with a focus on vvvv and VL.  The meetup follows the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org). 


##  Want to share your work?
Please do! Anything more or less related to vvvv, yourself and your projects. Share some thoughts, share your funny fails. Or just join and vibe with us… Submissions are welcome, please drop us a line: meetup@vvvv.org

## Do I need to know vvvv or VL to join this meetup?

No, absolutely not. The presentations will be about projects, patches, plugins or contributions made with or for vvvv, but you do not need to know it to enjoy the meetup.

## Attending remotely

Zoom link will be announced shortly before the meetup starts.

## Watching only

A Youtube link will be announced shortly before the meetup starts.

Any questions? Get in touch via meetup@vvvv.org. See you there!!
