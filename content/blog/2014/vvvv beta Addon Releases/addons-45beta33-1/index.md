may i have your attention please. 

two major things in the addonpack this time:

**HTMLTexture update**
Everybody say thanks to [meso](http://meso.net) for sponsoring an upgrade of the HTMLTexture nodes to now make use of CEF3, see [htmltexture-node-using-cef-3-now](/blog/2014/htmltexture-node-using-cef-3-now)

**PolygonEditor**
vvvv meistersch√ºler {{< user "dominikKoller" >}} gives to you: The PolygonEditor (2d) which following the tradition of vvvvs other editors (Point, Grid, Mesh) is patched from the ground up (including multiselection, snapping, keyboard-interaction, serialization,...). Only this time in a quite modular manner allowing you to easily adapt its functionality to your personal needs. Also with a beautiful seperation between model and view allowing you to easily adapt this to DX11. For a first usecase, see the revamped: {{< contribution "badmapper" >}}. 

Plus the usual smaller fixes, as you can see in the changelog linked below. thanks everyone for your contributions.
