changes, fixes and new stuff as you can see in the changelog. 
be reminded that many treasures can be found among the [/contributions](https://vvvv.org/contributions). if you like something from there to be in the addonpack make sure to bug the author to add it. 

and remember that you now have an easy way to support fellow patchers and coders via flattr as explained in the [flattr-on-vvvv.org](/blog/2014/flattr-on-vvvv.org) blog post.
