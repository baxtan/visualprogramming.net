On the 18th, we're hosting a free entry development night for Motion Controls and Virtual Reality at Game Science Center in Berlin. We'd love to have developers over who want to show their projects or ideas. We're also going to give away Leap motion hardware.

For more details as they are added, please visit https://www.facebook.com/events/1535626113336095/

There will be a talk by Leap engineer Isaac Cohen, Leap and VR demo's, and a kickoff to the Leap Motion Jam, that starts on the 19th. You can get hardware to participate in the jam here as well.

Interested? If you have a project or idea, let us know! kontakt@gamesciencecenter.de
