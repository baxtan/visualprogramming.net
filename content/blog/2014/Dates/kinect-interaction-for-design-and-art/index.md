Kinect: Interaction for design and art
workshop is part of [Signal festival Prague](http://www.signalfestival.com/2014/en/event/kinect-interaction-for-art-and-design/)

We will explore the possibilities of depth sensors such as Kinect in the context of site-specific art and interactive installations.

These sensors do not see how things look, they see where things are. This allows us to use the for complex yet easy to create interactions for public and private space. During the workshop, we will design and prototype public art installation using sensor Kinect and PC. We will also explore basics of binary logic, how could we use it in real space and real situations for public games, social experiments, interaction design? We will use the creative coding framework VVVV, however prior knowledge of this tool is not required. Workshop is suitable for artist and designers curious about innovative tools.

Workshop instructor is Andrej Boleslavsky. Reserve your place, workshop capacity is limited to 10 people. Participation fee is 19EUR. The workshop will be held in Slovak, or English per request/need.
