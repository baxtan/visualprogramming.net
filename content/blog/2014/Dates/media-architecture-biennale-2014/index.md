###  Workshop
#  Programming Natural Affect
###  Pavilion Building & VVVV Coding

This workshop proposes a new way to look at the interweaving of the natural world and urban life through the use of new media and architecture. Rather than trying to fully control / manage the relationship between the natural and built environment with computation (and its metaphors) this proposal sets out to augment the natural world. Thus creating artificial environments that evokes the organic. An architecture that artificially amplifies the experiences of nature that is diminishing in the urban context.

<!--break-->
This is to be done by reproducing the affect of nature in a new abstract manner and projecting this onto a public pavilion. How can the regulation of light mimic weather? Fog? Create a landscape type experience?

Here the affect produced and its experiential qualities is the goal of the project. Resulting in a new type of public pavilion/infrastructure for cities.

###  **Execution**
The workshop sets out to physically produce a small prefabricated pavilion. Participants and workshop organizers will together piece the blocks in any shape as they see fit. The blocks will have interlocking capabilities pre-fabricated and brought to the workshop. 

Following this an introduction to graphic visualization, open source and creative code environments will occur. Then the VVVV tutorials, layout methods and designing in real-time 3d diagrams. Finally the principals of projection mapping specifically related to VVVV and prototyping the various affects achieved onto the pavilion.

The end product is a pavilion displaying various co-created visualizations and their resulting affects by the participants for the public to enjoy. A pavilion that fuses analog and digital methods of production- thus creating opportunities for an architectural language for the digital experience. The final result will become part of the main exhibition at the Media and Architecture Biennale.
