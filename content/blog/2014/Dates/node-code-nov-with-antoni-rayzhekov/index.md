I want to share my experience and findings in exploring different strategies of sonification of biometric sensory data, motion tracking and audience participation in relation to digital scenography in contemporary performance context. How using cutting edge technology impacts and extends contemporary performance arts today?{{< /box >}}

My work is focused on exploring synergies between generative music, contemporary performance and participatory art by designing reactive audio visual platforms that amplify different aspects of the performer and the performance itself as an attempt to communicate the invisible.{{< /box >}}
