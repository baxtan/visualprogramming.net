VJ Union is a global networking platform for practising multimedia artists with aims to promote projects, discuss standars, educate each other, and expose works on an international stage.
VJ Union's Berlin event will be a freeform open visual jam session. Bring your beamer (if you can), toys controllers, software, friends and ideas.

For any questions contact Kimberley (mail above) or have a look at the facebook event https://www.facebook.com/events/313604708764504/
