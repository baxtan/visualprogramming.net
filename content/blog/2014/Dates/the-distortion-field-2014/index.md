Curated in collaboration between EWHA’s Cross Media Lab, Kimchi and Chips and CreativeApplications.Net, The  「Distortion Field」 objective is to facilitate a productive ‘scenius’ that nurtures creative intersections, exchanges and networks between practitioners in art, media, performance and technology. It aims to describe the effect of audience’s participation upon artist’s intention, the opportunity for audience collaboration within new media creations, and the professional framing of artworks through curation and documentation.

New technologies whether mechanical, biological or electronic are playing a major role in shaping contemporary digital art production. Unfortunately the discussion related to how this work is communicated often remains in the dark. Whereas “interactive” is commonly applied to “new” digital art production, in most cases these systems are simple, responsive and reactive. 「Distortion Field」 aims to reveal more complex feedback systems where the audience is an active participant and a contributor in both the experience and dissemination of this work.
