A night with Alex McLean & Kate Sicchio.
Dance Performance, talk, live coded music

"Sound Choreographer <> Body Code" 
by Kate and Alex

The dance performance ist a collaboration between Live Choreography and Live Coding, creating a feedback loop where the diagrammatic choreography react and reconfigure live to music, and where the dancer represents instructions in the code, which the live coder tries to edit in order to create the music. The result is a resonance through movement, perception and language, influencing one another in a live composition, forming a whole system.

Alex McLean is active across the digital arts, including as one third of the live coding band slub, co-founder of the TOPLAP (http://toplap.org/) live coding movement, generative dance music promoters Algorave, and he is research fellow in human/technology interface at ICSRiM in the School of Music, University of Leeds.

Kate Sicchio works at the interface of choreography and technology. Her work includes performances, installations, web and video projects. She has presented research at many conferences and symposia and has given artist talks at places such as Times Up (Linz), The Creative Data Club (London) and the EU Commission (Brussels). Her PhD focused on the use of real-time video systems within live choreography and the conceptual framework of 'choreotopolgy' a way to describe this work.
