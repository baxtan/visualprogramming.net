Patchers of the world. It is official: [ NODE15 Forum for Digital Arts](http://node15.vvvv.org) will take place in Frankfurt from from April 27th till May 3rd 2015. 

We will open the doors to enlighten your patcher soul within a week full of workshops, profound face-to-face exchange in the open lab, critical debates and lots of good moments to share.

With the leitmotif [“Wrapped in Code – The Future of the Informed Body”](http://node15.vvvv.org/#leitmotif) we will focus our program on the changing relationship between the human body and technology. This change is not only powered by the boost of mainstream access to highlevel technologies such as virtual reality devices, 3d sensors and prosthetic devices etc. No - the change is mainly driven through your creative developments, applications and projects. Its you who push the boundaries of whats possible, who make fictions becomes reality and who create new visions and fictions for the future. In other words: You are responsible for what is happening with our body in the future. 

Right now, we are working hard on curating an exhibition, lectures and workshops.  But want to hear about your needs: what would you like to see and whom would you like to talk to during NODE15? Use the [ OPEN CALL](http://node15.vvvv.org/#open-call) to suggest projects or your own work!
