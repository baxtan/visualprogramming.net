![](background.png) 

This years edition of the [retune conference](http://retune.de/2014/) has some vvvv going on. For your convenience i compiled the following summary: 

**prototyping interfaces**
{{< user "korriander" >}} and Mark Lukas of the team behind [the great book](http://prototypinginterfaces.com/) will give you an introduction into connecting things to and tinkering with vvvv. See: http://retune.de/2014/workshops#interfaces

**vvvv intro**
{{< user "robotanton" >}} and {{< user "joreg" >}} will give you an easy introduction to vvvv focusing on image manipulation/layering a la photoshop but in realtime. See: http://retune.de/2014/workshops#vvvv

**choreographic coding lab**
While not strictly a vvvv-only event the CCL will quite likely feature at least some vvvv as at least some people involved in this are quite familiar with it. See: http://retune.de/2014/workshops#ccl

Apart from the workshops their [line-up of speakers](http://retune.de/2014/speakers) looks quite fresh to me. And in the evening i remember them serving drinks. So get your [ticket](http://retune.de/2014/tickets) now and see you there.
