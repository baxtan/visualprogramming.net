This years edition of the [resonate](http://resonate.io) festival features quite some vvvv. Or at least the program features the usual suspects which makes us believe there should be some.. I spotted a performance/talk by Paul Prudence a talk by {{< user "timpernagel" >}}, a talk by {{< user "eno" >}} a talk/workshop by {{< user "elliotwoods" >}}, a talk by {{< user "Joanie_AntiVJ" >}} and {{< user "princemio" >}} participating in the [Choreographic Coding Panel](http://node.vvvv.org/choreographic-coding-panel-node-resonate/). 

What i didn't find yet though is a schedule with times and places for all the events. But probably they'll have that on spot.
