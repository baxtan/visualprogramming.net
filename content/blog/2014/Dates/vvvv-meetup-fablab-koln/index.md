It is happening everywhere!
While I organized the VVVV Meetup in Linz, I have nothing to do with the ones in Köln. It just happened to be there already and I wanted to announce it properly.

This is the 3rd Meetup already and this time there is also a considerable amount of new people. 

So the Meetup is intended both for specialists to exchange the hot stuff and for newbs to learn from each other. So we slow down and are more in the mood for a chilled workshop stile project lab. 

The good think is that we are in the Ding Fabrik, which is a newly opened Fab Lab in Cologne. It has to offer everything that you can imagine from 3d Printers and Platin Acid Baths, to heavy drills and saws and Textile and Raster Printing Corner.

It is a nice environment. Everyone is invited, it is free.

If you can not now, drop a mail to rnickels@alrami.de so he can take you in the mailing list.
