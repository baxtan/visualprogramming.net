▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ ★ Interplanetary meeting where every VJs bring their own beamer ★ ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

![](COVER%20date.png) 


▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
BYOB is a series of one-night-exhibitions hosting artists and their projectors. It gives the opportunity to people involved in VJing and other live visual arts to get in touch and connect, sharing their skills and showing their work to other collegues. 
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
BYOB creates an international temporary platform that brings an unique opportunity to build a global network for Vjs. Firstly conceived by Rafaël Rozendaal, BYOB has quickly became an excellent chance for VJs to meet other VJs, creating a huge collection of improvisative and temporary visual installations that reach its climax with the resulting BYOB party event. www.byobworldwide.com
