![Choreographic Language Agent tool](1782443_677658102278159_1672352693_o.jpg) 

We are entering a new series of NODE+CODE meetups in Frankfurt that revolve around the theme of "embodiment" as it relates to technology, code, digital art and the other things we do.

The first talk in this series is by Nick Rothwell (1), a composer, performer, software architect, programmer and sound artist. Nick is going to introduce the **field framework **(2) by the **OpenEndedGroup **(3) through a set of projects that he worked on.

Nick has a long history of projects that relate to dance and performance. He has worked with major companies in that field and on large installations. Please see his website (1) for a detailed list.

The field framework (2) has long been sort of a ghost in the area of creative coding environments. It is very unique as it is a true polyglot (Java, Python, Clojure, ...) system that enables both visual and text based (live) coding.

(The cover image depicts the Choreographic Language Agent tool which is part of the Becoming project (4))

Free entrance, be on time! See you in Frankfurt. We hope you can make it.
