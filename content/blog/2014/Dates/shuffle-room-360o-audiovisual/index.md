Shuffle Room is an interactive audiovisual installation designed to completely submerge the audience in a rich 360º navigable sonic environment.
The piece uses a quadrophonic audio engine and an edge-blending multichannel projection transforming the room into an immersive audiovisual experience where converged mashups of abstract geometric objects and micro sound textures are emitted at high intensity and frequency, while they are also constantly seamlessly coordinated in a coherent whole.
Centrally located, a monolith shaped physical object enables the audience to have complete control over their surrounding using said multi-touch interaction device. It invites participation of the audience, and once it receives feedback from an audience member, the whole space awakes with activity, provokes further experimentation by the observer. Their fingertips now become the environment, and the observer becomes a conductor of his own audio visual experience.
The exhibition explores the possibilities of a limited space and represents an ever-evolving state of shape and sound where new patterns are constantly emerged and rearranged. It creates dialogue between the audience and the environment exploring modes of interaction and responsiveness, input and output, human intuition and curiosity. 
Inside the custom built touch reactive interface, a real-time simulation software is situated, making use of various technologies and protocols all routed up in VVVV in conjunction with custom programmed audio engine running in Usine. 
Participating in this exhibition, the observer is highly empowered to become part of the exhibition, part of the world he is now in charge of manipulating. The sheer spontaneity of interacting and changing such a complete set of multimedia, fully covering the main senses, introduces a specific state of mind that is unique and leaves an imprint with lasting effects. 
Shuffle Room is developed as a collaborative work between Saso Puckovski (MKD) and Rodrigo Guzman (MEX), to be premiered on 7th of September at the art centre MÜSZi in Budapest, Hungary.
