![IkPan @ Trasformatorio](tras.png) 

Trasformatorio is about settling and developing an annual laboratory for performative arts in a remote community in Sicily: Montelbano Elicona (province Messina). This laboratory focuses on the development of contemporary site-specific performances informed by the human and geographical landscape as well as implementations of a philosophy of near-to-zero- environmental impact.

Marije Baalman and Alberto Novello will host a workshop employing techniques that could be of use in these site specific contexts. The aim of the workshop is to explore various body based sensing technologies, such as acceleromenters, bend/stretch sensors and muscle sensors, for sonification in performative contexts.

Using the Sense/Stage wireless sensing platform we will look into mapping strategies for the sensor data to transform body movements into gesture-controlled sound instruments. Examples will be given in SuperCollider and Max/MSP; the sensor data can be received in SuperCollider, PureData, and Max/MSP. After initial introduction of the concepts and framework, each participant will be able to explore different possibilities, and share experiences with the other participants. At the end of the workshop we will be able to do a little jam of the different instruments created.
