***STATE OF TIME Experience Science Film Festival*** features ground-breaking works from international filmmakers at the intersection of science and art.

Where would film be without time – the fourth dimension that grants movement to otherwise static pictures? Exclusively for STATE OF TIME, Imagine Science Films has assembled a series of cinematic inquiries, echoing the 7th Imagine Science Film Festival from 17.10-24.10.2014 in New York: From scientists trapped in time loops, the fragmentation of memory, and the mysterious powers of time-lapse to the age of mountains and the universe, the program will feature a full roster of short films and one feature film illustrating the many layered meanings of the concept of “time”.
