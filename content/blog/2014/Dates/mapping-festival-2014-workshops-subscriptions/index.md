#  MAPPING FESTIVAL 2014
##  WORKSHOPS PROGRAM AND SUBSCRIPTIONS
Mapping Festival, dedicated to audio-visual art and digital culture, celebrates this year its 10th edition from May 22 to June 1 2014.

After its success in 2013, we repeat the formula discerning professional workshops from events intended for the public. Articulated around various themes and technological explorations, conducted by international instructors who are specialists in their respective fields, the six workshops will be spread over the two weeks of the festival.
