Hi vvvv community,

We are currently looking for experienced vvvv artists to join our interaction team as freelancers or permanents for upcoming client projects as well as internal r&d. Our office is located at the beautiful Heyne Fabrik Offenbach (http://www.heynefabrik.de). We are developing complex interactive installations and exhibits on a very frequent basis. To get an impression of our work check out our website at http://madhat.de

If someone is interested please contact us at info@madhat.de 

We are looking forward to hearing from you and would love to welcome you for a decent coffee and a chat in our office!

Cheers,
The madhat team
