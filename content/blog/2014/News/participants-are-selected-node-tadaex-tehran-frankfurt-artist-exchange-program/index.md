Artists Amir Bastan (IR) and Georg Scherlin (DE) have been selected for the Tehran/ Frankfurt Artist Exchange Program. 

The program is co-organized by NODE - Forum for Digital Arts , TADAEX Tehran Annual Digital Art Exhibition and funded by the Goethe-Institut 

The TADAEX/NODE Residency Program enables an exchange between the prosperous media arts scenes in Iran and Germany. It connects the communities that have emerged around each festiva and enables collaboratives works between the cultures.

We are curios about their joint project.
