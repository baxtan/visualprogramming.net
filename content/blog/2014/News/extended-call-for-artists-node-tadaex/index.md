![NODE/TADAEX Residency Program](http://node.vvvv.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/call-for-artists-02-580x279.png)

**NODE - Forum For Digital Arts**, **TADAEX – Teheran Annual Digital Arts Exhibition** and **Goethe Institute** invite Iranian and germany-based media artists to apply for artistic residencies in Frankfurt, Germany and Teheran, Iran.

Goal of the TADAEX/NODE Residency Program is to establish an exchange between the media arts scenes in Iran and Germany, and to connect the communities that have emerged around each festival. One german artist will be invited to Iran (2014) and one iranian artist to Germany (2015). Both residency periods will last 2 weeks and lead into the respective festival. The artists will be invited to both festivals, and are encouraged to collaborate.

** Extended Deadline: 22.8.2014**
