not sure if this is the right place for license discussion but...

i quite like unitys license concept. 

*have a free version but let people pay for the pro-cross-platform compiler. 

*all (pro)people would have to pay for all your work which is just fair. 

*and not just a few license customers (try to) pay the party, which isn't fair.

there is something wrong with the current system. the dev's don't get payed and the few license buyers are paying a lot more compared to an expensive software package like unity. (just compare doing 10 projects with v4 or unity pro)
