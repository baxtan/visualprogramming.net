Can you help me decide among these three laser show equipment please?

First, I'm buying from online shops

Second, my budget is 500€ max, so if you have a different recommendation please tell me.

Now, this is what I have narrowed my search:

Single Green laser light show with eight heads (32€, free shipping).
Eight claw Pro lighting Red Green dj laser light (47€, 27+20 shipping).
Eight Multicolored Red + Green + Purple 200mW nightclub laser light (61€, 55+6 shipping, i could not find this one cheaper).

If you have a better option for around the same price range please let me know. thanks guys!

PS:Sorry for my poor English.
