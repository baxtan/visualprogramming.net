By design the system always protects a whole project and can then only load protected files. A mix of protected and unprotected source files is not possible.

You can however run two instances of vvvv, one in protected mode the other editable.

We've added this info to the [/Protektor](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/protektor.html) site.
