###  Call for application for the next Choreographic Coding Lab
###  Berlin, September 22nd-26th, 2014
Are you an artist working creatively with code and digital media with an interest in movement? Then come join us for the next Choreographic Coding Lab at Uferstudios in Berlin from September 22nd – 26th. Motion Bank and NODE Forum for Digital Arts are inviting you to [apply](http://choreographiccoding.org/#lab-retune-2014-form) for a week-long gathering of movement hackers and dance practitioners who will be discussing and working on projects, ideas and challenges in a peer-to-peer setting. The Lab will start before and run into the [retune.14 conference](http://retune.de/2014/) (September 26th – 28th) and will be kindly hosted by [Hochschulübergreifendes Zentrum Tanz Berlin (HZT)](http://www.hzt-berlin.de/).

Choreographic Coding Labs (CCL) offer unique opportunities of exchange and collaboration for digital media ‘code savvy’ artists who have an interest in translating aspects of choreography and dance into digital form and applying choreographic thinking to their own practice. Working with patterns, structures and movement through finding, generating and applying them with results ranging from prototypes for artworks to new plug-ins for working with dance related datasets. CCLs also seek to initiate a sustainable collaborative practice among its participants encouraging ongoing exchange in an artistic research community of individuals.

**Background**
CCLs are an outcome of [Motion Bank](http://motionbank.org/), a four-year research project of The Forsythe Company focused on the creation of digital dance scores with guest choreographers. This research involved the study, documentation and analysis of unique choreographic approaches. The datasets and tools used behind the development of the Motion Bank scores will be made available for the Lab participants. CCLs are curated in collaboration with [NODE Forum](http://node.vvvv.org/) as a high-level, intensive environment that maximizes interaction and exchange over a period of five days.

**CCL at retune.14 conference**
The upcoming CCL is supported by [retune.14](http://retune.de/2014). For the third time, the conference brings together artists, designers, technologists as well as researchers and scientists to inspire interdisciplinary thinking and making. This annual gathering of international creative minds seeks to explore, shape, and critically question the future of living, working, and expressing with technology.
The CCL will end with a round-up of results and discussion open to the public in the framework of retune conference.

Details & Application
The week will be enriched by lightning talks by members of the Motion Bank research team and network aimed to inspire and provoke participants with new perspectives and experiences. The space and basic equipment will be provided.

There is no fee for participation, but applicants are asked to propose starting points and ideas. Collaborative teams involving choreographers/dancers interested in the Motion Bank research approach are very much encouraged to apply.
