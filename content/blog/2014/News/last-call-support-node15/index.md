Every patcher with **1 spare €** please concentrate for a few seconds:

NODE15 is currently running [a crowdsourcing campaign asking for 20k€ to support the festival](https://www.startnext.de/nodeforum15) which they will not reach. That is fine because the money missing to the goal will be filled up by the [Kulturmut Initiative by the Aventis Foundation](https://www.startnext.de/pages/kulturmut) if - and only if - the campaign is among the top campaigns of Kulturmut. 

The sum we already reached (>5000€) is good. What we need now is a bigger number of individual supporters to show that NODE15 is relevant to a lot of people. Here is where you come in. It is baby easy, 
**no profile/login required**:

* go to https://www.startnext.de/nodeforum15
* in the right column select 1€ donation (or any other perk)
* click the "Support now" button
* select "I am new to Startnext and want to **support as a guest**." if you're so inclined 
* fill out the form quickly, so it **doesn't take you much time**
* press the required buttons. **done**. 

We have 7 days left! Spread the word about this and then see you all at #node15 around the corner.
