#  Dear lovvvvers
Right before christmas we finally managed to have the ticketing online for #node15.

NODE is a one week vvvv injection and we encourage everyone to take the whole week of your time and come to Frankfurt. The weekpasses are available now!!! Travel plans can be made. If you have questions about accomodations etc. please contact us at ping@node-forum.org

When the final workshop schedule is online by early 2015 you'll be able to reserve your seats in specific workshops. Only then we'll also start selling tickets for individual days.

##  Regular Pass vs. Company Pass
We distinguish between Regulars (Non profit artists, students, aliens etc) and Companies (commercial deployment of the collected knowledge). We trust your valuation which ticket suites you the best.

We are working on the financial situation, but we are still reliant on selling the company passes very much.

How to reserve a workshop seat? By early 2015 - when the workshop schedule is online - a user account is created for you. After logging in you can reserve workshops via the schedule on the days your ticket is valid.

Everything you know is wrong! 
The future will be confusing!
