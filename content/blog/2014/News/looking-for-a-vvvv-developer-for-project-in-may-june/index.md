We are looking for a vvvv developer to join our team for a project that we´re going to work on during May and June. 
It will be an interactive installation, launched in London around end of June, tasks are roughly:
- 2 users interacting at a time
- motion tracking probably with two LEAPs
- projection mapping on a 3D model 
- 4 different outputs on 4 different screens

Preferable somebody from Berlin to work with us in our studio. 

We´ll be happy to provide more details, when you write us an email to jobs(ät)onformative(dot)com. We´re looking forward to hearing from you.
