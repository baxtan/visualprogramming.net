Inspired by inFORM table of MIT’s Tangible Media Group (and the futuristic hospital bed  appeared in The Wolverine 3D movie), I started working on a patch in VVVV for controlling an “actuated matrix table”. The first use of the sotware I did is PLOTTING the 3D FUNCTIONs! It really funny…and visually stunning, expecially that looks very 8-bit style!
