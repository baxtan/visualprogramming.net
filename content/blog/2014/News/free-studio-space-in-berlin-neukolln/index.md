Hi vvvvolks

Again - we have a free space at our shared office plus the possibility to work on hardware and analog stuff in our shared workshop. 

The whole space is a large shared studio floor with 5 Studios and 10 Artists (three painters, one sculptor, two coders, two product designers, one precision mechanic, one 3d artist, one comic artist) at the southern end of Sonnenallee close to S-Bahn Köllnische Heide.

We have a large commonspace for meetings and any project-based experiments, (like larger projections etc...) a large freight elevator, some storage space and we will have a small garden. 

We just moved in, so anyone joining will still be able to have quite an impact on our profile and the interior design of the space. Even so everything is already set to start working immediately.

rent: 150,- (including VAT and everything else - u need VAT ID because it's "gewerbe")
