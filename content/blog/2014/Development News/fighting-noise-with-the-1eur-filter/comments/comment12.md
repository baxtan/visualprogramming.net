i am not sure why you ask about a filepath.. just doubleclick in a patch to popup the nodebrowser and type "oneeuro.." to make it come up. if it does not show up like this you are not running the latest version of vvvv. 

in case you're asking for the source, it is here: https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk/blob/develop/vvvv45/src/nodes/plugins/Animation/OneEuroFilter/OneEuroFilterNode.cs
