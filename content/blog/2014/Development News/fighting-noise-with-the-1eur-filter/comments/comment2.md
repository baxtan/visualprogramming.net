I've been using this filter for a while to filter head tracking data for VR (got it off the VRGeeks list), but never made it into a proper plugin because it is stateful, and couldn't decide how best to handle that in the case of changing spreads.  Does this implementation handle spreads, and if so what happens if the spread count changes?
