@lecloneur,

yes, the UI is the same in terms of that there are nodes which have input and output pins which you can connect by links. but it uses another graphics library which is zoomable, so no problems in terms of space and faster navigation in patch.

what other GUI magic would you expect for better readability, cleaner patches and node alignment (besides ctrl+L)?
