hm, i think this module could be easily cleaned up using some modules. When those subpatches are named appropriate i think that improves readability a lot (more than using no subpatches at all).

to be honest, i don't get the point, why you didn't use subpatches here - though there's this 'new' CTRL+G feature. This is the same with curved lines. i use them often to make patches more readable.

imo this camera module is (in terms of programming) a rather complex thing, which in return means, that it couldn't be represented in a really simple way. And if you'd try to code such a thing i.e. in c#, you'll see, that this would be a much much more complex and maybe irritating thing than this patch.

i'm also a very straight patcher, when it comes to those 'layouting' tasks. but i think it's always worth the time to cleanup things and thereby walk through your patches with a birds view.

the only features i'm missing in current GUI is: zooming (announced) and some kind of snapToGrid (where the grid spacing should be the same as the pin spacing).
