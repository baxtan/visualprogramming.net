Looks pretty cool. But are all "setters" synchronized to being evaluated in one frame and all "getters" within the next?

If so, wouldn't it be nice to being able to quantize the evaluation cycles independently from frames to a different pace, e.g. to create faster cycles for recursive functions? How about a "sync-to-frames or sync-to-clock" function? How about a numer of "user-clocks" for each patch?
Just brainstorming..
