It would be nice to have some kind of auto alignment to avoid random nodes positions while patching. VVVV is extremely powerful to program something very quick and even make huge project.

But then you have to spend the same amount of time to keep everything clean and readable (just in case you follow Meso's advice about having 6 blocks on a patch, which works really well).

A snap would be also extremely useful as output and input pin are still really small. For me, it has always a little bit strange to see how organise and straight is the vvvv in the beginning. Grey square, straight line, top to bottom logic, but finally patch are always messy because it's too much work to clean all of it.

CTRL+L somehow does the job, but now if you want to keep patch really clean you must use it all the time. And we can all agree that CTRL+L is definitely not the most "handy" shortcut :)

The "balance" between left hand on keyboard and right hand on mouse can also be greatly improved to make patching less stressful. Every actions now must start by a click on mouse, and if we want to change anything about that, it's not possible.

Here is an example of what I'd love to make faster, avoiding line to cross too much. I spent 25 minutes to clean the camera softimage node (without making subpatches, which could improve readability) and almost no use of CTRL+L (because it align node but don't make "straight" connection)

This "straight style" is really how I feel vvvv is by its GUI design but it's a pain to achieve this for every patches... which I do because I'm crazy :)
