Hi Timonski,
what do you mean by "server is connectable", "Nil for the Image format". 
Which node are you using to connect to Photoshop? Please check your Firewall settings set for Photoshop. 
We've tested the connection using the last two CC 2014 versions, so that's not a problem.
And maybe it's better to move the conversation to the [Alpha Forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/)?
Please start a thread there.
Best,
Anton
