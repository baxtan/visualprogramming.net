Hi Sebl,

thank you! 
What is missing now in this node is the RAW 'format', we just need raw bytes of the texture without any 'File Format' headers, compressions and so on.

It calls pixmap, just a simple sequence of bytes representing color of each pixel. That's for sending uncompressed data to Photoshop.

Best wishes,
Anton
