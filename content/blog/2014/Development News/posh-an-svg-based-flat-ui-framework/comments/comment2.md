Interesting stuff you got there.
But if you use browser as UI engine why did you take only SVG and ignored everything else, like JS and tons of great libraries? UI is not just vector graphics and text. It is also controls, animations, etc. Which, correct me if I'm wrong, you'll have to implement yourself on C# side.
