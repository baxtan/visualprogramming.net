will it be possible to have some kind of config file where we can define our color charts, based on our habits ?

Looks like GUI problem remains the same if you don't give us any tools to make patch cleaner.

Indeed, it is possible to have really clean and tidy patches but it takes so much time... because we can mess up things in two dimension in vvvv and this CTRL+L shortcut is for big hands only.

Can't wait to try this new beta though. Good luck guys.
