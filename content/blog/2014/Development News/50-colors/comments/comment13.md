Cool!

Would be nice to draw the selection in a polyline manner instead of rectangular selection only. Like drawing an area around a set of nodes which would put them in a group visually ... or not just coloring the links and pins of the operations but also the used nodes.
Oh well, sorry, asking for too much!

Thanks, looking forward.
