you know, i appreciate any work on the timeline tool but the performance/framerate/responsiveness of the UI in the current state is a bit disappointing. 

if i understand it right, this is due to pushing the stuff to the browser and might speed up if running in vvvv. right ? hopefully! or is it due to "slow vector graphics" ? ;)

in terms of layout, use of screenspace, shortcuts etc. is still a lot of space for improvement and a long way to be a production tool. its an experiment,ok... and i'm happy to alpha test more.
