thx @gregsn for further details!

i like the idea of subpatches being something like *factories* (one can subscribe to).
this indeed introduces a more dynamic way of handling object collections (formerly spreads?).

from the language perspective i am starting to like it :)

i guess this is still a bit away, but how will the plugin interface change, or will it actually convert to just a "node API"?
