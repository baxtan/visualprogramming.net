The direction you are (or seem to be) taking with vvvv50 is very interesting and I'm looking forward to see what the future holds.

The biggest challenge/risk and what I can't really tell from what's shown so far seem to be how well the GUI metaphors will work. Get that right and it will be awesome and probably interesting for a whole lot more people outside the current vvvv users.
