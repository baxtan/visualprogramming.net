Nice! 

Great news joreg! If there's one thing I dislike about vvvv it is the difficulty to patch something 'object-like' when working on a more complex project/logic - even more because OOP is such a common programming paradigm. I mean, yes - there are tricks and tweaks but it can be really tedious sometimes. Anyway I'm really looking forward to see how you guys will implement this new functionality in the real-time patching flow of vvvv and I can't wait to get my hands on that and test it out!

Keep up the good work!
