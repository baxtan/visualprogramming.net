some people said the same, but what might be scary about it?{{< /box >}}

{{< box >}}quote:sunep:
it's always scary to need to learn to think in a new way.

to me it seems like it will end up being a lot closer to "conventional" programming and to me relatively deep into "old" vvvv thinking it seems like I need to be quite a bit more abstract when patching. It's probably super cool once we all get into it, but the whole linear spread and cross thinking to make a checkerboard will become more complex... or?{{< /box >}}

{{< box >}}quote:bjoern:
VVVV is the foundation of most of my current work, I make a living from it. Now something new is introduced and I like what I've seen so far. But a big part of information is left out. There is no roadmap for the development of 50 (I know of). No insight on what your plans are with 45 once 50 has been officially released and so on. This introduces a lot of uncertainties which could have a big impact on my (work)life...

Also think of potential new users. Like joreg said in the video you have to wrap your head around one paradigm (spreads) and then (in a not so distant future) you can forget about it and start learning something that is vastly different from scratch. So why bother.{{< /box >}}

@scared people: as i understood spreads won't disappear but most of the stuff you'd do in plugins you can do that now in patch! i mean what i do most of the time nowadays is just creating objects in plugins and when i finished sorting and mangling with them i will convert those to basic spreads. doing that in patch would be superawesome.

however my question is that how we should imagine the library importing function? what portion of a namespace will be represented as a node?{{< /box >}}

{{< box >}}quote:hadasi:
Where you used to think spreads you could now think lists. I know its a little more complicated than that but when you're making an object it could be made from lists of data. And when you want a lot of objects you make a list of them too. Stuff can be added or removed from the list and the properties of the objects can be sifted rather than worrying about exactly which index you'll need. I think... Correct me if I'm wrong, David. I'm not exactly a C# junkie{{< /box >}}

{{< box >}}quote:microdee:
yeah you're correct, however the sifting part is done with dictionaries rather than lists. what i'm amazed about is that to create a dictionary you don't have to write a plugin for that, now you can do that entirely in patch. vvvv50 in fact will be a node based .NET development environment which is a HUGE thing even in the outer scope of vvvv community. it's a "microsoft will rise his eye-brow" huge thing!
also 2nd question is that the dynamic plugin concept is dead too?{{< /box >}}

two hearts in my chest. i'm slightly sad that vvvv's different approach to programming (read spreads) is abandonend after 10 years. and i'm excited about the new concept. although i find the representation of OOP as graphical programming a little clumsy and hope there will be early community alpha testing to incorporate feedback{{< /box >}}

could there be a pixel datatype that works in the gpu?{{< /box >}}

{{< box >}}quote:milo:
but on the other hand.. it sounds all so ...kind of plausible especially if i think of all the great plugins which already make use of oop for quite a while now.

for instance i would never try to make complex list operations out of spreads anymore as there is the possibility to just make the use of dictionaries right now

but i agree with bj√∂rn about the roadmap for the future of 45.{{< /box >}}
