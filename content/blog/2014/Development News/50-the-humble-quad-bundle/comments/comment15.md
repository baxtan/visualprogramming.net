Wow! As this looks very interesting indeed, i see the slope of the learning curve for beginners going up with some sharp (hehe... #) edges. i agree with {{< user "u7angel" >}} on that.
If i am not mistaken this borrows concepts from reactive programming techniques? with some base of "more object oriented approach" as the current node approach for a graph is like!? compressed down to a 2d representation. we will not loose the patch and i really respect the work concerning that representation regarding different lifetimes and "connecting" these lifes with cords.
having objects with a longer lifetime is something i'll be definitely looking forward to, but, sorry, it just doesn't read well in the patch with the "invisible tardis cords". ... yes, maybe codename it *Tardis* ;)

Nevertheless too questions to read it better:
* will there be a lot of *Get...* nodes?
* are the black dots something like *sinks* and *sources*?
