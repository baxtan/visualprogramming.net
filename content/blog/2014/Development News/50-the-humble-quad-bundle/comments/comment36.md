thanks everyone for your feedback. as mentioned above we'll address individual topics in the coming months with more detailed blogposts. 

so please don't be alarmed too much yet by things you can't understand from the sparse information we've provided so far. we're still very much in a process of understanding things ourselves and figuring out the best way to make a transition for everyone as plausible as possible. spreads will be in our hearts forever but we have this suspicion that at some point noone will really ask for them anymore..
