@jens.a.e

the 'factories' that you see are right now called *regions* which are in fact higher order functions which are defined in another patch, something every patcher can do. these are just examples of this very powerful feature.

the plugin interface will not be necessary anymore, its all just code. so the only thing you would have to do is basically write a method and it will appear as a node.

joreg talks a bit about this after about 17 minutes in this video:
