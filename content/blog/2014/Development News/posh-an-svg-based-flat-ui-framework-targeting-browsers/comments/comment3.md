@vvvvalentin: we've considered going full HTML instead of only SVG but turned out to be much simpler to start with a small approach. of course the idea can still be expanded..

having said that, posh is definitely not for all kinds of guis. still regarding animations: i made simple tests with css-animation that worked nicely. so everything you can do with css is totally for free.
