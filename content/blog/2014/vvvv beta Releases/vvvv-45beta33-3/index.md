helo patcherpeople,

here is the third release in the 33-series just exactly a month after the last one. Mostly bugfixes and specifically quite a performance-boost. So updating is highly recommended. 

For more details about the 33-series see the changelog and the previous announcements: 
* [vvvv45beta33.1](/blog/2014/vvvv45beta33.1)
* [vvvv45beta33](/blog/2014/vvvv45beta33)
