*ascii donut. again.*

helo patcherpeople,

nothing fancy this time. basically exactly the same as before only that scratch better. Ah one fancy thing there is actually: the new helppatches for {{< node "Renderer (EX9)" >}} and {{< node "DX9Texture (EX9.Texture)" >}} plus some new girlpower\Graphics\DX9\Texture patches. Check em out. Gorgeous. 

If you're new to beta 32x you should also be advised to skim the previous release notes: [vvvv45beta32](/blog/2014/vvvv45beta32) not to miss anything. 

And note that you still have the privileged opportunity to be among the first 10 people in the universe ever to flattr vvvv. Think ahead, this may later be a crucial point in your résumé..

have a good patch,
yours devvvvs.
