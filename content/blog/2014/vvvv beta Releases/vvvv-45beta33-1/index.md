![](headquarter.jpg) 

say helo to the bugfix-only release: 
 
 vvvv_45beta33.1

Some of you have pointed out that [a little bogger](forum) slipped through testing and made it into beta33. We're sorry for that and while at it we also fixed [another](forum). Probably noone has even noticed that SharedMemory (EX9.Texture) was still broken since our switch to /dx9ex (with beta32) and still we fixed that one. And also Kalle (VVVV) should is back in the game. 

Read the rest of the news for the 33-series in the [vvvv45beta33](/blog/2014/vvvv45beta33) announcement and have a good patch (now really).
