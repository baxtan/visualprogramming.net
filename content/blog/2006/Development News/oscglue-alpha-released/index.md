for all timeline addicts out there...  OSCGlue will connect VSTbased sequencers to the world of OSC. Now you can control your VVVV patches with Ableton Live. 
Write a text file to specify which OSC parameters you need, open up in the sequencer, and you will have a VST plugin with all parameters as specified..
