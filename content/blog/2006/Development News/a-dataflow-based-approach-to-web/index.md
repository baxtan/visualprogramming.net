During the last month there has been some research work at the meso labs. 

Starting from the thesis Graphical Web Server Programming by [David](https://legacy.vvvv.org/users/david) and Björn we have written a research paper which precises the advantages of visual programming of web applications. The paper will be published and presented at the [WSEAS Conference of Communications](http://worldses.org/conferences/2006/greece/iccom/) Athens, Greece, July 13-15, 2006.

As a vvvv user you can already download the paper here. Hope you like it.
