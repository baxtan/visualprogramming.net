we are pleased to announce that egosoccer has won the [play-award](http://www.play-award.com) competition for &quot;innovation in football&quot;.

YAY.

still only a prototype egosoccer cannot really be played. it is not exactly cheap to realize, but some [stills](http://joreg.ath.cx/egosoccer_stills.html) and a [video](http://joreg.ath.cx/egosoccer_movie.html) are available that hopefully gives you a good idea of the..idea.

the video is also shown at the play-award exhibition (see poster on the left) among 30 other entries to the competition. 

4444 thanks to [time's up](http://www.timesup.org) the inventors of [spin](http://www.timesup.org/spin) without which egosoccer would not even be a prototype.
