<!--{SPLIT()}-->
logically called the [&quot;MAKE CONTROLLER KIT&quot;](http://makezine.com/controller/)
1. It's by my favorite DIY mag, [MAKE](http://www.makezine.com)
1. It's quite a lot more expensive than arduino (ca 150 us$)
1. It's 32-bit, has an Ethernet interface, and runs freeRTOS.

= the next step in cheap microcontroller multipurpose platforms.

I can't wait for the VVVV-to-Artmel compiler. (iiiiifffff....)
