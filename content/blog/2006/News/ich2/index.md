**ich²** is a dance performance combined with a **360°** projected stage. the venue we use is a tiny planetarium in Kiel where we implemented vvvv to enable us to do cool realtime visuals and play pre-rendered videos. 

the whole performance is slightly a media overkill. the dancers will be able to control elements of the virtual stage and sound with the help of motion sensing techniques (cameras + body sensors). but basically the whole 360° projection will blow your mind as it perfectly fools your brain 

for everyone who's interested, check the website (only in german right now) and get a ticket. sure, kiel is far off but it's probably worth the journey ..

for all vvvv forum veterans...if u need a place for your sleeping bag, send me a mail ce(ääht)muthesisus.de
