It was brought my attention this morning that Richard &quot;Doc&quot; Bailey passed away. 
&quot;...Spore, his original software for abstract image construction, gestated in one of his down periods and he quickly put it to use in all sorts of features and broadcast design.  Think of the planet in Solaris, the collapsing buildings in Fight Club, and generally most things hallucinogenic in features of the last decade, and he was the guy working out of his basement who made them.  ...&quot;

His work can be seen at [www.imagesavant.com](http://www.imagesavant.com).
