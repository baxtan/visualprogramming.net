## vvvvolks! 

The new VVVV website version 3 is online. As you can see, not only the style is new, there have been also a lot of structural changes. Content is structured a bit different to the previous version. have a look around and enjoy!!!

here are the most important things you have to get used to.

* the [Fan Club](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/chat.html) section is your new home. Here you can find the recent changes, last forum and blog posts as well as the bazaar, which is the place for sharing stuff. Make this section to your home-page if you are visiting us often.
* the entrance page instead is meant as an introduction for newbies and poeple who haven't really got into vvvv before.
* when editing a wiki page or any other object you should categorize this object in order to expand the corresponding navigation submenu.
* The login-box appears only in the [Fan Club](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/chat.html) section or if you are logged in. 

please check you userpage if it still looks as you expect. the complete site is a bit smaller then before. it might happen on some pages, that the right side is cutted. please edit those pages. If you find something you can't edit on you own, inform us in the [vvvvorum](tiki-view_forum.php?forumId=2).


your dedicated (web) servants at vvvv.
