i finally got vvvv to run on my psp. aaaakay its only via a vnc viewer. but that is already quite nice and lets you at least experimentally control patches wireless from the psp. speed is variing from actually usable to stuttering. controls of the psp are not so intuitive for patching and i haven't found the double click yet.

for those interested get [portablevnc](http://forums.qj.net/showthread.php?t=50252) and the [eLoader](http://www.noobz.eu/) for homebrew software. i used the 0.97 &quot;alternate bock&quot; version for a 2.0 firmware psp.

still i am waiting for a native osc-sending-application for the psp. and this one goes out to you: if there is not one available soon if i had the time..
