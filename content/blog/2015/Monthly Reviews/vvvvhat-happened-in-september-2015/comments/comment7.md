thanks for the mention, very flattering :D

I take your task, joreg. Next month shall be mine.

I am very much for the monthly RE VIEW; so community: Sharing ain't so hard. Keep it going! Upload! Think of it like that: Every patch can be a teacher to someone, no matter your personal point on the learning curve. You never know, there might be a noob longing for your knowledge, there might come a master, that just simplifies your knot in your head or even the yoda that noodles it all around in a way never expect you did.

You guessed it, this is both a forward memorial for the pro users, and a friendly invitation for everybody who just wants to celebrate her first vvvv-pride moment in public as well. Clean up, share and you shall be mentioned.
