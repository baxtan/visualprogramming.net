wellwellwell,

that obviously didn't work out as i planned. {{< user "velcrome" >}} who won the competition to write the review for october apologized for being to deep into vvvv projects to make it this time. fair enough, hard to argue against the generating of licenses.. so let me try this again.

first: if you haven't already done so, do yourself a favor and switch to the latest and greatest:
* [vvvv45beta34.2](/blog/2015/vvvv45beta34.2)
* [addons45beta34.201](/blog/2015/addons45beta34.201)
we haven't heard any serious complaints about it yet. just sayin... and also the addonpack now includes a polished version of @manuel 's original photoshop-layer reader. that should be quite useful for some of you.
* and here are just a few notes on what has recently changed on vvvv.org: [website-updates-2](/blog/2015/website-updates-2)

## Contributions

again there've been a couple of new or updates to existing contributions. as always you can [find them all here](https://legacy.vvvv.org/contributions), this is a list of only my favorites:
* {{< user "vth1618" >}} shared his {{< contribution "excel-reader" >}}
* {{< user "gumilastik" >}} forgot to add a changelog but apparently there's an update to his {{< contribution "htmltexture-(dx11)" >}}
* {{< user "honix" >}} shared his {{< contribution "polar-menu" >}} in dx9 and dx11 flavours
* and from {{< user "u7angel" >}} comes a quickndirty implementation of an {{< contribution "object-character-recognition" >}} algorithm

not a contribution yet, but i am hoping for one here: {{< user "AKa-visuals" >}} posted this [nexus-renderer](/blog/nexus-renderer) screenshot followed up by a pointer by {{< user "synth" >}} to https://github.com/triss/duplex-nexus-osc now combine this with exposed IOBoxes and there you go..anyone?

also it seems {{< user "LaserLars" >}} is working on something gcode related, see: [gcoderimage-engrave](/blog/gcoderimage-engrave)

## Oldies but goldies

this section is to point out older contributions that should be quite interesting to some of you. this time: if you're using OSC a lot to communicate between different instances of vvvv or even other software/devices, you should have a look at this as a probably more comfortable alternative:
* {{< contribution "mqtt-sender-receiver" >}} by {{< user "korriander" >}}
* related node15 workshop material: https://github.com/JOxBERGER/IoT-Intro

## Gallery

from the things that landed in our gallery in october i found this interactive game by students of the [Muthesius Kunsthochschule](http://en.muthesius-kunsthochschule.de/) quite ql. not only because it features a computer voice! 
{{< vimeo "134966915" >}}

then i stumbled upon the [Apollochatter](http://ursbasteck.com/wordpress/151003) by Urs Basteck who apparently is using the {{< contribution "evvvvil-tweet-engine" >}} 

if you haven't seen it yet, go watch: [Mirror (M2)](https://vimeo.com/140405048) by the always crazy <http://schnellebuntebilder.de>

also, if you're among the unfortunate that use instagram you might as well follow these profiles for they are posting quite nice vvvv images from time to time: 
* https://instagram.com/waltzbinaire/
* https://instagram.com/schnellebuntebilder
* https://instagram.com/idwyr/

## VL stuff

just a little update regarding VL: we're hard working-on/learning VL ourselves. it's coming along very nicely. latest additions that can also be used in vvvv (if you use the latest [alpha](https://legacy.vvvv.org/downloads/previews)version):
* [/forum-alpha/artnet-vl-plugin](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/artnet-vl-plugin/13360) (multi subnet/universe node)
* [/forum-alpha/leap-vl-plugin](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/leap-vl-plugin/13344) 
* and {{< user "tonfilm" >}} wrote us a nice roundup on what you get regarding [polar-spherical-and-geographic-coordinates](/blog/2015/polar-spherical-and-geographic-coordinates) in VL

anyone up for doing the november review please stand up (in the comments). again, if nobody wants to do this i'll eventually appoint someone.

meanwhile thanks everyone for your great contributions, have a great month!
