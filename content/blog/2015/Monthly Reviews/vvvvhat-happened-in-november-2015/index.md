ouright scratch that,

it seems everyone is just too busy to write a review for last month so i'll appoint myself again. oh thanks. i'm welcome... off the top of my head i remember that again a lot of things happened last month, so lets see what i can find...

## Contributions
i visited {{< user "woei" >}} at his desk last week where he showed my some crazy stuff thats still to come. but he has already cleaned out his harddisk and found the following:
* {{< contribution "simplecloth" >}}
* {{< contribution "ardrone" >}}
* {{< contribution "mqtt-revamped" >}}

also the following got updated:
* {{< user "everyoneishappy" >}} updated his {{< contribution "instance-noodles" >}}
* {{< user "zeos" >}} made sure his {{< contribution "print-printer" >}} works with latest vvvvs
* {{< user "tekcor" >}} provided a dx11 version of {{< contribution "ft-cubic-lens-distortion" >}}
* {{< user "vasilis" >}} provided a dx11 version of {{< contribution "polar-menu" >}}

## Teasers
and a lot of teasing this time:
* someone has gestures [gesture-(devices-window)-help](/blog/gesture-(devices-window)-help)
* {{< user "microdee" >}} has a [mitterline](/blog/mitterline)
* {{< user "tmp" >}} is working on his Pointcloud lib: [one](/blog/writer-(dx11.pointcloud-raw)-help) and [two](/blog/server-(dx11.pointcloud-raw)-help)
* {{< user "AKa-visuals" >}} is promising an editor for the nexus ui lib: [nexusuieditor](/blog/nexusuieditor)
if you know your github and can't wait for contributions help yourself with these: 
* {{< user "velcrome" >}} pushed his [ZeroMQ](/blog/sockets-on-steroids) lib to [github](https://github.com/velcrome/vvvv-ZeroMQ)  
* {{< user "microdee" >}} pushed his [ironhydra](/blog/ironhydra) lib to [github](https://github.com/microdee/IronHydra)

## Gallery
i forgot to mention this beauty by {{< user "lasal" >}} last month: [tesela-interactive-paper-sculpture](/blog/tesela-interactive-paper-sculpture). this time i couldn't really decide on my favorite...so i go for the obvious:
{{< vimeo "145836531" >}}

but also these are worth watching:
*{{< user "everyoneishappy" >}} has a [360° thing on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLpJrkeKHNE)
*{{< user "zeos" >}} is working on a new performance: [somaphony-demo-2015](/blog/somaphony-demo-2015)
*{{< user "id144" >}} in style again: [guest-andrej-boleslavský-samuel-kerridge](/blog/guest-andrej-boleslavský-samuel-kerridge)
*{{< user "ain" >}} is going big with [MIMPI-v-2](http://www.stain.ws/MIMPI-v-2)

and new in my rss-reader this month: https://uberact.com/blog/

## Education
a lot of things going on education-wise. most notably of course mr. {{< user "microdee" "microdee" >}} has started his series of weekend workshops. not exactly very straight workshops one could argue, but definitely interesting vvvv-entertainmaint if you have a few hours to spend. he provides uncut version of all livestreams is his [vveekend vvorkshops youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8Vqigdbq5Gam_6dcGdNBw).

{{< user "vux" >}}, {{< user "ain" >}} and {{< user "idwyr" >}} apparently have something coming up in moscow [polytech.science.art-week-audiovision-lab](/blog/2015/polytech.science.art-week-audiovision-lab).

if you happen to be in beautiful venice coming weekend check out these: [2-workshops-interactive-art](/blog/2015/2-workshops-interactive-art).

{{< user "eps" >}} and {{< user "antokhio" >}} talked vvvv at the cg-event in moscow [one](http://www.cgevent.ru/?p=10746) and [two](http://www.cgevent.ru/?p=10843).

and if today i were to choose a study, i'd apply here: http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/
it seems they had a nice vvvv-workshop running last week which they flooded twitter with. if you're quick you'll find a bunch of nice snippets posted by students here: https://twitter.com/search?q=%23vvvv

phew...the end.
