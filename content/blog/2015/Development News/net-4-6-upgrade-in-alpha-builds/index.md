In order to run the current alphas (34.100 and up) a [.NET 4.6](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528259) installation will be required. The setup.exe will already check for that.

For our dear developers using the [vvvv-sdk](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/devvvveloping/vvvv-sdk.html) a [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs) installation (which is free) should provide you with all the tools required, for those who prefer [SharpDevelop 5.1](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Download/#SharpDevelop5x) the [.NET 4.6 targeting pack](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528261) and the [Microsoft Build Tools 2015](http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=46882) should get you up and running.

A nice overview of all the different .NET downloads can be found [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/p/dotnet_sdks.aspx).
