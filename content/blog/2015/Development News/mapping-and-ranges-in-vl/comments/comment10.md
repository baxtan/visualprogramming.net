yes, a big part of the library is patched. it is very convenient because you can use adaptive nodes to make patches which work with many different data types which is what you want in a library.

concerning the UI question, the hidden (or much less space consuming) values in pins will be back in a later UI iteration. list as well of course... but not dates are fixed yet.
