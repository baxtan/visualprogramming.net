hey tonfilm i think it depends on the perfomance of the GUI, we know that IOBox's takes most of the processor performance on huge patches, so why do same in VL, maybe try two types pin and field with representation of value. Pin just a connector between patches (however would be nice to see all that it holds inside with inspektor) and field is kinda slider with graphics representation of value.
