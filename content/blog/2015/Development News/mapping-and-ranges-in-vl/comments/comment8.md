@tonfilm, probably need to get used to the fact the whole language is patched anyway. 

concerning ioboxes, values hidden in pins might confuse a beginner but it allows to distinguish between important values and not so important.. making the patch more readable.

question: is there a way to have spreaded ioboxes like a list ?
