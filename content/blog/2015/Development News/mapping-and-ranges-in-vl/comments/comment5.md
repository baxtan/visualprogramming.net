looking at the map image, i still find it hard to see an improvement compared to vvvv

while in vvvv i just need a map node, in vl it seems i need 7 nodes to achieve the same setup. this makes the patches crowded but also requires a lot more user interaction. i dont want to imagine how my patches would look like with that kind of noise..
