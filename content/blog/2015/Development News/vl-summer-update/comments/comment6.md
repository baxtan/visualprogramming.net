@u7angel: 
exactly. The plan is to stick with the high level vvvv and lower level VL combination for now. We put some work in that integration and i think that the combination really gives you a great toolchain (vvvv) to realize your projects, which now will come with a new integrated tool (vl) to solve some hard problems you stumble upon.

VL was born to solve problems that you can't solve with vvvv. It therefore starts from the other end of the spectrum. Over time we'll strive to get it easier to use and less noisy (which is hard if you still want all the language features, but we'll still try hard). 

For the higher level project patches: we might end up with design patterns that favors only some few language features for those patches (like the use of process nodes) and disfavors others (which you only should use in lower level patches). We also had discussions about another higher level patch layer (that works different), but then again the incompatibilty between the different levels might get a pain. So this is only an option if there is no other way around it. 

So for now we are happy with the combination of both systems vvvv & VL, since vvvv is strong for those higher level project patch. When VL becomes bigger and finally offers everything you need for your project, we'll definetly see how we can get the top-down high level easy to enter aspect back, but for now see it as a tool for people that want to solve a hard problem with a visual language that just can't be solved in vvvv directly. (since it is too high level for that problem........)
