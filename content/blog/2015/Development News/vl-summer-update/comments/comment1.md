hei microdee, thanks for the flowers. regarding the release of type importer: the reason for not having it released yet is that we're only now in the process of really using/testing it ourselves. we need to understand it a bit better and document some default workflows before we release it to the public and everyone starts importing stuff like wild and gets dissapointed when we cannot answer questions about problems they will encounter. so yes, you'll get it when we are more confident about it. until then we'd be more interested in language feedback (as mentioned above).
