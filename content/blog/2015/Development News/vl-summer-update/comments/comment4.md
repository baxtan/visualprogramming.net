@gregsn, a late thank you for your elaboration

while having a look at VL here and there, i started wondering why you abandon the conciseness/simplicity of vvvv and introduce - i may say - this noisy language. and you have to admit its noisy. i guess sunep did a good example a while ago and the firmata VL is also a good example.

would it be thinkable to have a higher level patching style (i.e. old vvvv) as the default way and an advanced mode VL style living together in this new piece of software ?

or is this the plan anyway ?
