"compile executables"  "will run on anything that has .net" are little statements that instantly made a lot of people dream of running vvvv in OSX and on linux (I dreamt of running it on embedded systems) and that took focus away from it actually being a great way to refine and tweak the language without everyone starting out beind super disappointed the it still needs a lot of refinement.

I suspect there will be a new "statement" about the current state and direction, to set the expectations when beta35 comes out, probably in the not too distant future.
