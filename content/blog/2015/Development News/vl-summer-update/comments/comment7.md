@gregsn, so we can teach design students the "easy" way of patching and the brainiacs can dive into "low level" programming. sounds good to me.

your way of developing the next gen vvvv makes absolutely sense, from complex to simple. i never really noticed this is the plan, it came accross differently or i wasn't listening carefully enough.
