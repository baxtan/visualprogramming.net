lieber eno, i rather have something that works than being trendy ;) i'm allowed to say that i'm disappointed that most features promised at node13 are not here. i don't really care much for a "visual c#" since i'm fine with writing code when it suits the purpose.

to make this clear, i'm well aware that creating a new language paradigm is some crazy bit of work, which eats time for breakfast. on the other hand, some people would have liked to see other feature/improvements first.

but i'm sure it's all coming together at some point. 2017 ? ;)
