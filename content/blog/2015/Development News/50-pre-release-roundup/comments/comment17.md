@ggml well in theory that's what IDEs like visual studio or SharpDevelop do by default. our importer tool opens a library in a very similar way. you can browse it, decide which types and methods you want to import and most importantly adjust category/node/pin names if they are not to your liking. this is how we currently work on the basic library of nodes we want to ship with VL.

Once we have proper documentation and guidelines we will release it and users can import whatever they need for their project.
