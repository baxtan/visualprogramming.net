true rogerlette,

huge complex patches with zillions of links, framedelays, dynamic created/deleted objects with sifting id, plugins with dictionarys to keep track of the state etc, etc are just a pain in the ass to build atm, not talking about maintain them later. i hope VL helps with all this issues!

@u7: this problems cannot really be solved by just writing plugins unless you keep everything in one huge plugin or divide it to several plugins with custom datatypes (like in box 2d). but thats not really elegant im my opinion.
