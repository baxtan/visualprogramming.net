Unfortunately won't be at Node but looking forward to get to try 50/VL.

Personally I find a visual programming language/environment for CLR/.Net more interesting than an incremental/feature upgrade of vvvv45.

50 may very well come to appeal to a much broader range of developers than vvvv has so far while it might initially disspoint parts of the existing vvvv user base due to missing features as well as splitting developer attention between support of the old and the new.
