hey ele, i didn't say at any occassion that vl is a bad idea, right! just hoped and hoping for advances in different areas of v4 than the language. and i prefer a more gradual development style with a smooth transition rather than rewriting everything and then having a long phase of bug finding and fixing.

proof me wrong but with this rewrite it will take a long time until this can be used in production.
