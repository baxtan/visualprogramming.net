IMO this is exactly the right way to go - focusing on laying the foundations for others to add more functionality/nodes.
Spending lots of time getting DX rendering stuff to work would likely have taken away precious development time from much more important things - i.e. making vvvv50 usable at all and finally getting an alpha out.

For my personal purposes this is absolutely great news, given that I rarely use DX rendering stuff (I'm dealing mostly with lighting installations) - that DX stuff was mainly causing problems for me in the past (think cross-platform).
I'm confident that once these basic foundations have settled, new functionality will land rather quickly - likely with help from the community if possible. Who says the rendering stuff needs to be developed by the language core developers anyway?

For the time being, you can still use the "old" vvvv for your DX rendering stuff, while starting to play around with the concept of the new one :)
