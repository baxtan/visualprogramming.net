I am optimistic that it will go in the right way.
But I feel also some turbulent time ahead and reshuffling of existing power (force) structures in the realm of data flow programming. VL can be a great future but as always with fundamental change it could be too much and split everything appart. So that we have in the end VL only used by mac users and vvvvjs ruling the world of mobile devices and the heavily mutated DX12 vvvv, now let by u7angel and vux, keep dominating windows, with a dark futuristic UI

However, thanks for keeping us updated, realy exciting!
