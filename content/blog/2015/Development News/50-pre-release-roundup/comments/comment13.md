Will there be networking nodes? Or is there a way we can have a VL plugin for vvvv so we can do the logic in VL and render in vvvv? 

Guessing the reason for not releasing a renderer with VL is the same bug as vvvv's crazy GUI. If I could write logic in a super clean UI with VL and send it to vvvv for rendering that would be awesome!
