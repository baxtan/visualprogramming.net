I'm mostly using vvvv for other field than computer art and rendering stuff, I face some limit with big v4 patch, 50/vl is a real future for me.

So I more than support you dear devvv team :)! Even if the baby is not able to walk and speak yet.

For the transition period : It's true that running vvvv patch into 50/vl or the opposite would be super great...
