@sebl: though not finished and still under discussion - yes, it is patched and yes it is just a patch that reports to implement the interface "IRenderable". It does so by actually defining a "render" operation (in addition to the create and update operations you are used to). Anyway it might not make it in the first release. Let's see.

@vux: we are busy on polishing details that hardly can be changed once it is out (especially semantic details of the features we want to commit to and the selection of those features...). So yeah. We have no numbers for you yet. Sorry.
