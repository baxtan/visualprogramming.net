i am officially excited. you know, this is like a vision finally becoming elegant: patching oop dataflow visually.

my timing is propably a little early for this, but I have three and a half questions:

1. what is Circle doing exactly?
2. this ingenious foreach-block, does it behave lazy, like linq? other way to ask: do you cache the nodes as expression trees? 
3. will it be possible to attach custom attributes to class members (e.g. fields)? this is necessary for serialisation, tests, etc. can this be modified during runtime?
