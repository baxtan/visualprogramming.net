i am officially excited. you know, this is like a vision finally becoming elegant: patching oop dataflow visually.

my timing is propably a little early for this, but I have three and a half questions:

# what is Circle doing exactly?
# this ingenious foreach-block, does it behave lazy, like linq? other way to ask: do you cache the nodes as expression trees? 
# will it be possible to attach custom attributes to class members (e.g. fields)? this is necessary for serialisation, tests, etc. can this be modified during runtime?
