*Computer Art (improved)*

helo again,

just moments later we give to you: **45beta34.1**
Basically the [same as before](/blog/2015/vvvv45beta34) but definitely the one you'll want to use from now on since it has a few more buggers fixed.

In case you have a minute check out the revamped helppatch of the division node that explains the newandimproved behavior for division-by-zero situations. Otherwise just keep on patching as usual..

Also note: this may be actually the final version running on XP. 

Like it? Flattr it!:
