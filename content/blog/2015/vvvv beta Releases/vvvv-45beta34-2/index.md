*Computer Art (even more better)*

and again, just moments later...

this is to announce the immediate availability of: **45beta34.2**

Similar to [45beta34.1](/blog/2015/vvvv45beta34.1) but now really the one you'll want to use since it has even more buggers fixed, most notably:

- Camera (2d/Softimage/Orbit) are working again in fullscreen
- Separate (String) works again for all separators
- Texturesharing works again in x86 builds
- fixed troubles with saving/loading patch with a Timeliner

And as always don't forget the [addonpack](/blog/2015/addons45beta34.201).
Also note: This may now actually be the final version running on XP. 

Thinking about flattring it? Just a click away:
