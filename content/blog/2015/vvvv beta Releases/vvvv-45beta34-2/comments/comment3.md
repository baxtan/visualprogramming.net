@iobox raw: you're saying it behaves somehow different than a string iobox with the same amount of text? if so: demopatch please

@xpath: that is usually the case when the .dtd is not found or the {{< pin "Resolve Externals" >}} (which enables looking for the .dtd) is off. since the CR entity is defined in there.
