*ALT+T*

helohelo,

we don't want our latest fixes to rot in the alpha-builds so here you get a new maintenance release of the 33 series. as usual please see the change-log for all the details but here are the highlights:

* a couple of fixes for some of the RAW datatype nodes
* fixes to udp/tcp/boygrouping
* fix for an age old problem with Automata (Animation)
* the new [1â‚¬ Filter](/blog/fighting-noise-with-the-1%e2%82%ac-filter)
* new in \girlpower
**\Transformations\Drag
**\Graphics\DX9\Geometry\Dynamic Meshes 

looking for the new [nodes to remote Photoshop](/blog/2014/hello-photoshop-0)? don't forget the addonpack!

so all in all not much, just better. and therefore also this modest release marks a perfect occasion for a click down there, if you're so inclined:

or if you're totally wild even check if your licenses need an upgrade: [/licensing/my-licenses](https://store.vvvv.org/orders)
