Well, when I run crack/setup on WinXP after 31.2, I get a red light on .NET 4.5, and the installer for it does not work as it is not supported on XP.  I spend enough time fighting my tools as it is, that I'm not going to bother with something telling me right up front there's a problem!

So if these later versions can run on XP without .NET 4.5, what is the problem?  There should have been some message saying what functionality would be missed - I'm not going to try something and then wonder forever after if some problem I'm having is related to that red light...
