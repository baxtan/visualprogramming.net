helo patcherpeople,

did you know that [Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on April 8, 2014](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/end-support-help)? Do you bother at all? Well, we do. And this is why we're releasing one last version of vvvv that blissfully runs on XP. And it is also the bestest version of vvvv ever (so far). Say helo to: **45beta34**

Branching off 45beta34 from all future developments has become necessary because with [VL](/blog/2015/vvvv50-vl-pack-alpha) we now need always the topofthepops .net version which is no longer available for XP. beta34 is therefore the last release in the 45-series. Next will be 50beta35 requiring .net4.6 and including VL. But more on that later. 

beta34 comes mostly with bug- and performance fixes. So definitely the version you should want to use from now on.

Note:
Due to changes in the plugininterface (see changelog for details) it may be necessary to rebuild plugins for this release. So all contributors: If you have stuff that is not in the addonpack, please provide a fresh build of your contribution/pack.

Out of interest: Anyone still using XP? Please raise your hand in the comments. 

And as always if you feel so inclined, we never mind a flattr:
