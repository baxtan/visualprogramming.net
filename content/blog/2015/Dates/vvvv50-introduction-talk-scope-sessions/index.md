On Thursday 8th Jan all vvvv interested people in Berlin will have an opportunity to get a peek preview of the next big vvvv thing.

In the past few years we’ve been eagerly working on a complete rewrite of vvvv which lead to a new visual programming language in combination with a development and runtime environment. Tebjan Halm ({{< user "tonfilm" >}} ) and Elias Holzer ({{< user "Elias" >}} ) will give a short introduction into the key features of this new language we’re internally calling "50".
