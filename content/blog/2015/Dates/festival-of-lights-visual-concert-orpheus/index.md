#  description
We hereby invite all of you to our visual concert during the Festival of Lights in Berlin.

Let yourself bewitch of our extraordinary visual concert. We combine the charm of painting and the fascination of light with spherical sound of the flute to a rousing cosmos. The legend of Orpheus develops before your eyes into a living painting.

see you,
Johannes
