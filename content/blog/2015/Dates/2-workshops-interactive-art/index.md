Since 2011 Toolkit Festival has been organizing meetings with international artists who move in the field of experimentation with new art forms related to interactive technology.

The training of December 2015 provides for two workshops: interactivity of the body with Kinect camera and smart fabrics Wearable technology.

REGISTRATION DEADLINE: November 30, 2015

Workshop "Digital Body": 5-6 December - H. 11.00-18.00

By Martín Romeo

The workshop provides the tools to build a project based on the use of multimedia (digital sets, audio-visual performances, interactive installations, etc.). The following topics will be tackled:  problems and phases in the construction of a process, from production to staging, in order to realize one’s artistic work. The workshop explores in terms of both theoretical and practical points of view, the aspects that make up a show of contemporary dance or an installation. It aims to further understanding of the differences in the creation of these two art forms, namely the manner and timing by which the elements are used and combined: body, music and image.


PROGRAM

Endless creations
Introduction to Vvvv software, learning functions and main features that will be used during the  workshop days. It will be shown how to program in real time, starting from the connection of multiple webcams to map and modify the surroundings by one’s presence or movement, making them interactive. With reference to the personal experience of each participant, situations and spaces to pursue a strategy of production and projects presentation will be identified.


Interactivity and body image

Kinect camera will be introduced to connect real and virtual reality: recognition of the human skeleton, identification of its movements in space and use of the infrared. Participants will be given the knowledge to understand the operational characteristics, in order to create a relationship with the image. The latter follows, responds and interprets according to its change and the parameters that the artist –director has preset in the software, assuming some matches.

REQUIREMENTS

Each participant should be equipped with his own computer running Mac or Windows and have the latest version of the Vvv software  (free download from www.vvvv.org).

The workshop is open to artists, students, professionals or people interested. Knowledge of the software used is not required.


Workshop "Wearable and e-textiles": 7-8 December - H. 11.00-18.00

By Luca Frogheri

The workshop on interactive textiles and wearable technologies aims at providing the basic tools to approach a project using some of the textile technologies today available and the prototyping board Arduino Lilypad.

PROGRAM

The course will start from the first theoretical and practical basis to handle Arduino, using kit textile sensors and will end with the realization of a practical project. Textile sensors are made of conductive fibres and are placed in the middle of two realities that share many basic values but where electronics and crafting hardly meet. This intermediate position opens a window on several developments and projects hardly possible before.

The program: Introduction to Arduino environment and Lilypad,  first practical tests and approach to programming. You’ll be able to figure out how to start managing digital and analogical sensors and actuators in practice, thereafter starting to work with textile components discovering their typical features. The differences between various smart fabrics and textile sensors will be dealt with, finally creating  a small project.

REQUIREMENTS

Regular attendants are asked to bring their own laptop on which the software has been previously installed  (free download from www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
No problems with different operating systems. The workshop is addressed to students, professionals, artists, fashion enthusiasts, interested in experimenting on a field somewhere between fashion, design and development of interactive projects.
