It is a pleasure to invite all vvvv interested people in London to a replay of the vvvv50 intorduction [talk from scope sessions](/blog/2015/vvvv50-introduction-talk-scope-sessions) at the RCA Kensington in the Stevens Building.

It is on very short notice, but I hope that a few patchers can make it. So spread the word!

Big ups to {{< user "hadasi" >}} who managed to find the date.

In the past few years we’ve been eagerly working on a complete rewrite of vvvv which lead to a new visual programming language in combination with a development and runtime environment. Tebjan Halm ({{< user "tonfilm" >}} ) will give a short introduction into the key features of this new language we’re internally calling "50".
