Cheers to all who came along and please pardon the fire alarm the had us all chucked out into the cold for a little while.

Thanks to Tonfilm for the demo and special thanks to Jelka K. for doing all the real work for this presentation. 

Interesting new features. Taking advantage of them will mean more clicks than we're used to, and there are some extra concepts to get your head around to fully exploit how they may enhance your patches, but it won't take long; spreads, while powerful, are harder to fully understand and control. Without the aspect of slice management, the tangle of a lot of patches will be greatly reduced.

And to the beginner who just wants get making things, I think the GUI update may actually make the learning (and teaching) curve smoother... a Mac version would help too ;-)
