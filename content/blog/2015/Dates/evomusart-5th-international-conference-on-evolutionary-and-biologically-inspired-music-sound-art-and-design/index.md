CALL FOR PAPERS
EvoMUSART 2016
http://www.evostar.org/2016/cfp_evomusart.php

5th International Conference on Evolutionary and Biologically Inspired
Music, Sound, Art and Design

30 March - 1 April 2016
Porto, Portugal
Part of evo* 2016
evo*: http://www.evostar.org

###### DEADLINE EXTENDED : 11 November, 2015 

NEW THIS YEAR :
*** PAGE LIMIT : 16 PAGES 

Following the success of previous events and the importance of the field of evolutionary and biologically inspired (artificial neural network, swarm, alife) music, sound, art and design, evomusart has become an evo* conference with independent proceedings since 2012. Thus, evomusart 2016 is the fifth International Conference on Evolutionary and Biologically Inspired Music, Sound, Art and Design.

The use of biologically inspired techniques for the development of artistic systems is a recent, exciting and significant area of research. There is a growing interest in the application of these techniques in fields such as: visual art and music generation, analysis, and interpretation; sound synthesis; architecture; video; poetry; design; and other creative tasks.

The main goal of evomusart 2016 is to bring together researchers who are using biologically inspired computer techniques for artistic tasks, providing the opportunity to promote, present and discuss ongoing work in the area.

The event will be held in April, 2016 in Porto, Portugal, as part of the evo* event.

Important Dates 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission: 11 November 2015*
Notification to authors: 04 January 2016
Camera-ready deadline: 18 January 2016
Evo*: 30 March - 1 April 2016

Publication Details
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions will be rigorously reviewed for scientific and artistic merit. Accepted papers will be presented orally or as posters at the event and included in the evomusart proceedings, published by Springer Verlag in a dedicated volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. The papers which receive the best reviews will be nominated for the Best Paper Award. The acceptance rate at EvoMUSART 2015 was 27.9% for papers accepted for oral presentation, and 25.6% for poster presentation.

Submitters are strongly encouraged to provide in all papers a link for download of media demonstrating their results, whether music, images, video, or other media types. Links should be anonymised for double-blind review, e.g. using a URL shortening service.

Topics of interest
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions should concern the use of biologically inspired computer
techniques -- e.g. Evolutionary Computation, Artificial Life,
Artificial Neural Networks, Swarm Intelligence, other artificial
intelligence techniques -- in the generation, analysis and
interpretation of art, music, design, architecture and other artistic
fields. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

-- Generation
- Biologically Inspired Design and Art -- Systems that create
drawings, images, animations, sculptures, poetry, text, designs,
webpages, buildings, etc.;
- Biologically Inspired Sound and Music -- Systems that create
musical pieces, sounds, instruments, voices, sound effects, sound
analysis, etc.;
- Robotic-Based Evolutionary Art and Music;
- Other related artificial intelligence or generative techniques in
the fields of Computer Music, Computer Art, etc.;

-- Theory
- Computational Aesthetics, Experimental Aesthetics; Emotional
Response, Surprise, Novelty;
- Representation techniques;
- Surveys of the current state-of-the-art in the area; identification
of weaknesses and strengths; comparative analysis and classification;
- Validation methodologies;
- Studies on the applicability of these techniques to related areas;
- New models designed to promote the creative potential of
biologically inspired computation;

-- Computer Aided Creativity and computational creativity
- Systems in which biologically inspired computation is used to
promote the creativity of a human user;
- New ways of integrating the user in the evolutionary cycle;
- Analysis and evaluation of: the artistic potential of biologically
inspired art and music; the artistic processes inherent to these
approaches; the resulting artefacts;
- Collaborative distributed artificial art environments;

-- Automation
- Techniques for automatic fitness assignment;
- Systems in which an analysis or interpretation of the artworks is
used in conjunction with biologically inspired techniques to produce
novel objects;
- Systems that resort to biologically inspired computation to perform
the analysis of image, music, sound, sculpture, or some other types of
artistic object.
