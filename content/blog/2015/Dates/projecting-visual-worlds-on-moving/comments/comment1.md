hey ggml yes the matrices exported by rulr are available for vvvv...But i think its not a good idea to give workshops with a tool, which is not publically released by its founder. However its a brilliant tool, and im sure it will be THE standard-solution-tool - once its out. However IMHO Rulr's main contribution lays not in simple pointcloud-projector calibration (which can be done very easily in OpenCV) - but propably beyond.
