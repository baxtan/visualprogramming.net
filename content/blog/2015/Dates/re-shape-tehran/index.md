Re-Shape is a place for creative technologists of all levels to exchange ideas and to present their work complete or in progress. We are currently looking for participants who are willing to talk and exchange ideas about their project. 

We have 5 main focuses but we'd love to hear about your projects even if you doubt that they fit in any of them: 

* Design/Code
* Audio
* Performance
* Physical Computing
* Interactive Media

We are also looking for participants from outside of Tehran who can present their work via Skype.
Check out our website at <http://re-shape.io/> for more details and click on register to join our presenters and sign up to our mailing list on the website for announcements and more information. 

We look forward hearing from you with a submission.
