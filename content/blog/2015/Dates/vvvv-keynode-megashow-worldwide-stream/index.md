19.30h part one: Contributer presentations
21.30h part two: vvvv50 world premiere (now really!)

All times are Berlin UTC+1 times.

Further details:

A lot of things have happened since the last big gathering of vvvv enthusiasts for NODE in February 2013. We'll have a look back to remind us all of what happened since and let contributors demo us their latest and greatest.
 
And remember when last time we gave a cocky demo of that next big thing? That new version of vvvv that will bring us a lot of joy (and despair)... we have more of that, this time. The only difference, this time it's for real. Whatevvvver we have knocked together until this evening will be yours to test. Promised.
 
Also there shall be music, drinks, games,... schaun sie sich das an!
