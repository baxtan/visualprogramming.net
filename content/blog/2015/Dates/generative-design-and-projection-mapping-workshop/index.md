Space Under is an Independent Research Center for Architecture and Technology based in Athens, Greece.

www.spaceunder.com

In this workshop participants will be introduced to visual design with vvvv with a focus on projection mapping. 

Participants will be guided through the basics of the software and will then focus on how to setup and design projections. 

At the end of the workshop you should have learned how to create patches from scratch and how to project on unusual surfaces and geometries. 

The workshop aims to a final projection mapping project of 1:1 scale on a geometrically complex structure.
