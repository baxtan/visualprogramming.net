Are you an artist working creatively with code and digital media with an interest in movement? Then come join Motion Bank and the team at the Deakin Motion.Lab in Melbourne, Australia for the next Choreographic Coding Lab where movement hackers and practitioners will be gathering to discuss and work on projects, ideas and challenges in a peer-to-peer setting.

The Choreographic Coding Lab (CCL) format offers unique opportunities of exchange and collaboration for digital media ‘code savvy’ artists who have an interest in translating aspects of choreography and dance into digital form and applying choreographic thinking to their own practice. This format supports working with patterns in movement scores and structures through finding, generating and applying them with results ranging from prototypes for artworks to new plug-ins for working with dance related datasets. The CCLs also seek to support a sustainable collaborative practice among its participants encouraging ongoing exchange in a growing artistic research community.{{< /box >}}
