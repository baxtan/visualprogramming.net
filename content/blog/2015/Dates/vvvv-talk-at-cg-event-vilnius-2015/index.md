![](CGEvent_2015_Vilnus_vvvv_3.png) 

The talk at [CG Event](http://www.cgevent.eu/) will be about "Building Interactive Installations with vvvv". I'll start with a short overview of projects realized with vvvv and will then move on to show how to build an interactive demo from scratch.

Anyone in Vilnius?
