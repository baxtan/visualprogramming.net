heyhey!

For all of you who are at the Ars Electronica Festival:

A part of the Festival, called U19 Create Your World, will exhibit (among other cool things made by young creative people) the winners of the Prix Ars Electronica u19 category. 

My work <http://dominikkoller.net/UnknownFormsOfFace> will also be there! It's been awarded an honorary mention.
You'll see it running live, right on the spot, patched in vvvv.

See you there!

Cheers,
vvvvpraxisintern dominikkoller
