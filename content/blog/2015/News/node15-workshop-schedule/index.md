Here we go,

turns out it is quite a hassle to get 48 workshops run by 58 hosts in 5 days in 7 rooms under a single hat. You see the gorgeous result above and can [get the .pdf here](http://node15.vvvv.org/sites/2015.node-forum.org/files/node-workshop-timetable-312-150219-04-1.pdf). Now it is on you to find your personal path of interest through the week and [get your ticket](http://node15.vvvv.org/#tickets). Full workshop descriptions and booking of individual seats will be available by next week!
