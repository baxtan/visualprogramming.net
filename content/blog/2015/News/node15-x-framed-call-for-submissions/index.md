What the FRAMED*?

*FRAMED is an internet-connected display that allows you to showcase digital artwork in a dynamic way that is still true to its native canvas. Designed to bring born-digital works beyond the computer screen, FRAMED enables users to showcase and experience an infinite selection of digital  artworks in everyday environments. With its unique interface and social platform, anyone can publish and sell digital works. Hang FRAMED on your wall, choose an artwork, and transform your space into a living virtual gallery of creative expressions.*

From the perspective of vvvv FRAMED is a quality made all-in-one flat-screen computer that runs Windows and as such, a potential platform of choice for vvvv-artists interested in getting their work out.

For [Node15](http://node15.vvvv.org/) we've worked with the team behind FRAMED to get vvvv running on it so you can be among the first to make some hands-on tests on the 5 devices they are bringing to node. At the same time we'll be running a small exhibition of your works on FRAMED at NODE15. We have 3 dedicated devices and we are calling for submissions to have your work displayed during NODE.

From today you can upload your artworks in either vvvv45_beta33.7_x86 or [vvvv.js](http://www.vvvvjs.com/) format and everyone will be able to view them during node. While for vvvv.js you simply provide a URL, we've created a {{< contribution "framed-template" "template for vvvv45" >}} that provides a simple setup to start from.
