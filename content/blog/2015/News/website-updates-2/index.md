I've been meaning to write this for a while already, sorry for the delay. Here is what has changed for vvvv.org in the past months:

## Server update

Since we had a lot of trouble with the server freezing randomly in the past we spent ourselves a new one in May this year. The transition went well and the random freezes are gone. So all is good now except some rare "too many connections" errors you may have encountered, but those usually only last a few minutes. 

## legacy.vvvv.org

The bad news though is that with the transition we had to let go of legacy.vvvv.org, which was a readonly version of our old (prior to July 2010) website. We tried to save what we can: so when finding a link in a forum post that points to a file of the old file-gallery that will still work (you won't even notice). It seems only what we forgot is files that were uploaded to the old forum...those are now gone, sorry for that.

*fukcingly amazing* legacy.vvvv.org/tikilegacy.vvvv.org/tiki

The good news is that the amazing Internet Archive has a [capture of legacy.vvvv.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20100712030750/vvvv.org/tiki-index.php). Really mostly interesting for historians. But then from time to time someone remembers a shader that apparently hasn't been moved to the [contributions](https://legacy.vvvv.org/contributions/contributions/1351/all) and guess what the fukcingly amazing Internet Archive has? [Exactly!](https://web.archive.org/web/20100613124902/vvvv.org/tiki-index.php?page=user+shaders)

## Website tweaks

And here is a few little things we've improved for the website:
- when now writing @username in a forum thread that user will be notified by email
- the main navigation-menu now shows its second level on hover allowing for quicker navigation
- are you on [diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/)? Add yourself to this list {{< user "connections/diaspora" >}} by entering your username in your settings: [/home/settings/personal](https://legacy.vvvv.org/home/settings/personal)
