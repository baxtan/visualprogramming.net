Regarding

'Running vvvv.exe /dx11mode:nvidia will try to auto select nvidia card for optimus setup'

Seems like even without extra flag my Nvidia GPU is now always used, which is not good at all my system is overheating very easy and is very loud.

How can I set it to acept the standart system settings again?
