-> Ok, nice that we can flattr the whole team
-> Ok for flattr concept. I actually like the concept, kind of grouping my donation, and I can adjust the global amount. 

-> For the last point I agree but : To start, I load my account with 50€ and setup 10€ monthly budget in the gui. So I guess they will take those 50€ directly to my bank account in one shot, not 10€ each month of course. That's why I said "it's killing the concept of monthly donation", which is precisely made to spread donation and make it more smooth for your budget.

And I guess, that in 5 month I'll have to go back on my flattr account to load it..(after receiving this email). Which is not a big deal, but still if I had to do so for all the services I suscribe online it would be enoying. (unless they are all on flattr :)

Anyway, I will do this huge effort for v4 :)
