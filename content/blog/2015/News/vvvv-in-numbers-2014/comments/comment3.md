Ok nice! 

I have to assume that I did not understand the concept at first then. I'll look at my account and setup this. Difficult question now is, if I want to support the heart of "vvvv team", who should I support? I basically know the vvvvdev on the stage at node : Gregsn, Elias, Tebjan, you. Then the other on the stage Sebastian O, Max... Then some very active contributors too.. It's difficult to choose, and there are probably people backstage doing great job too? And the more I support, the more you will only be able to buy an olive to put on your slice of pizza :)

Sorry to be hidebound but I still think that flattr is less efficient than a donation tab on the top right corner of the website, with simple choice, 5€, 10€,20€,30€,50€ monthly suscribtion or fixed one shot donation.

Anyway, you can do watever you want about this, I just hope that financial situation is not thorn in the foot of v4-v50? project, and that you keep enjoying.
