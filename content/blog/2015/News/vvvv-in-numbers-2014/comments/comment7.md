if i get their latest update right it seems flattr is working on a way to "enable automatic refill (of your flattr account) when money is needed", so that would solve the issue you still have with your idea of a monthly donation. see: http://blog.flattr.net/2014/10/flattr-developer-update-3-payments/ under "adding money". then also see "sending money" for the other issue.
