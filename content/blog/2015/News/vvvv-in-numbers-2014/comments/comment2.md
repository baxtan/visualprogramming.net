hei roger,

see thats exactly what flattr is so good for. as i described here:
 [flattr-on-vvvv.org](/blog/2014/flattr-on-vvvv.org)
in section "how" point 4]: 
"instead of a single flattr you can also **subscribe** to users/things by clicking a flattr button twice. a subscription meaning that you'll auto-flattr that user/thing every month (until you cancel the subscription via your flattr-dashboard)"

you don't spend time on that. you just decide who/what is supportable every month, subscribe to it, done. and via your flattr dashboard you have a convenient overview. they even send you a monthly spending report by email..
