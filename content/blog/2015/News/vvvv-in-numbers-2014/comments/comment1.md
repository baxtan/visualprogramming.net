Hi Joreg,

Thanks for thoses statistics :)

About flattr, I used it once just after you setup the system, but I'll be honest, I dont want to spend my time to make micro-donation for each v4 member.

I use v4 really often, mostly for non commercial project (I just did one commercial project = 1 license since 2008!). I really feel I could give more to support the team (you deserve more than slices of pizza:).

But for this I need a convenient donnation system, just like all other organisations I use to donate to (wikip√©dia, ngo, online news papers). A system where I could suscribe once to a monthly donation, and forget about it then.
I'm sure some company would be glad to monthly contribute too, in addition to the license system.

Of course you already study the question, and you probably have a good reason not to do it?? Up to you...


Long life to v4 (and the new album)!
