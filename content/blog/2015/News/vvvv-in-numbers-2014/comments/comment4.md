Sorry to spam this post but I tried to setup this, and flattr is not really working as a monthly donation system Joreg. Its working as a prepaid account. You have to go regularly on your flattr account to fill it.. 

So let say I want to make a 10€ monthly donation to v4 (spread to each devvv). I have to go every month to load my account with 10€, or I have to load 120€ to be quiet for a year... which kill the concept of montly donation. Moreover, flattr as a 10% fee, wich even more than paypal donation system.

I just insist because I would love a system where I can focus on my favorite software, and forget about money stuff.
