Today tune in for a not the most professionally organized "vveekend" vvorkshop about Emeshe. Because of christmas I visited family in Hungary however I've left my beloved PC in London (there's no picture because of that). But fear not and say big thanks for {{< user "KX" >}} for letting me use his PC so you guys won't miss vvvv powa during christmas either.
About the actual topic Emeshe is an advanced deferred rendering engine capable of doing let's say real-time realistic renderings with a lot of noise. More info here:

So this workshop will start at 1PM GMT or 2PM CET on
