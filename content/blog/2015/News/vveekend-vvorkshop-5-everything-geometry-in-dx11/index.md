![pimp your vvvv bro!](scr6.png) 

Ladies and Gentlemen! This weekend we will start the vveekend vvorkshop vvisuals subseries which will be four sessions with two guest stars: {{< user "idwyr" >}} and {{< user "everyoneishappy" >}} where we will dive into vvvv's graphics capabilities. You will know how to proper pimp your vvvv project if you'll follow these workshops.

The first of the vvisuals session will be about how to deal with DX11 geometry in vvvv and then in shader. We will go through the structure (or the lack of it) in a geometry, how to PLEASE bury finally DX9 (for folks still afraid to change I'd strongly recommend this one ;) ) and how to deal with your data/geometry on GPU for the braver vvvvolks.

NOTE this workshop will be streamed on Sunday instead of Saturday because of some personal reasons. So to summarize: stick your eyes on your interwebz viewer devices on

**6. December, 4PM GMT / 5PM CET [](http://www.twitch.tv/vveekendvvorkshops)**

See you guys on vveekend!
