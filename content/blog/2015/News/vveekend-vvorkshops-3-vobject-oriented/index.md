On this weekend we will dive into an object oriented set-of-mind in vvvv and learn how to solve problems which might be difficult in dataflow by introducing an other set of problems which you don't have to care about normally. Did you ever have headaches caused by the horrors of spreading? Now meet the horrors of objects. Reality is a real douchebag.

Seriously though, despite a different set of mind VObjects can also make your patches more streamlined and help you avoid link cobweb throughout your entire project. Make your data more organized, editable from multiple sources from downstream or even upstream without leaving the warmth of vvvv.

Join us this Saturday on http://twitch.tv/vveekendvvorkshops at 4PM GMT/UTC or 5PM CET
See you on vveekend!
