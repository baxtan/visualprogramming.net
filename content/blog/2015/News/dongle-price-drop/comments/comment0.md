I heard a few rumors... Is it true that the Golden Edition incredible licensing experience will last even up to 18 hours? If the PC wants to have a shower, can it leave the Golden Edition plugged, or is it better to unplug it? Will it tap when a user, oh well!, multiple users interact with the installation? If I use microwave with the Golden Edition, does this extend the license? Do you plan to release a microwave?
Thank you.
