**Dear NODE lovvvvers,**

weeks of website buidling and [fighting drupal](http://cdn.sixrevisions.com/0372-02_cms_learning_curve.jpg) resulted in a great digital home for NODE15:

<http://node15.vvvv.org>

Hopefully you all know this site already, got lost in the program and promising workshop descriptions and are planning your trip to Frankfurt right now.

**BOOK YOUR WORKSHOPS NOW**

Just have a look at the [program](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/community-forum), buy yor week or day pass if you didn't do that so far and log in to book them! As you might know from the schedule there are workshops that last a whole day or even two days. If it's possible for you, please book all sessions of one workshop.

Btw, wondering why there was a delay with releasing the booking system?
We have the best excuse and a very cute reason: Tom, alias baby Jenett-Horn :)

Best regards from the NODE15
