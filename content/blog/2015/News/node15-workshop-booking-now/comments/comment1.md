Guys I just sent an email to ping at node-forum explaining my situation...
I would love to go,,, but all the courses that I want to attend are full... I can stay stand up for 1 week if that's necessary, no problem... but I want to be sure that I would be able to assist the courses.
please check an email from andresc4 at gmail.... Or let me know where to address that email...
