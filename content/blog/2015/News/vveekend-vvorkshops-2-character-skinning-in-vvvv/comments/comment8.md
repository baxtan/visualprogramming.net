@evvvvil @microdee 
regarding kinect2/skinning, have you seen this? [forum](forum)
it includes a mesh by @antokhio that is rigged according to the kinect2 skeleton spex. number/names of joints are correct and therefore the mesh already moves correctly with the tracked skeleton in the demopatch. only orientations are not correct thats why it looks a bit weird. anto said he struggled to get those right, but maybe it is a good startingpoint for someone else..
