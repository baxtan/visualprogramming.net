Hi vvvvolks!

Next instalment of vveekend vvorkshops series will be on this saturday starring vvvv *hypermegasuperstar* {{< user "evvvvil" >}} and he will show us a pipeline of exporting things from C4D into vvvv and preferably animating it with assimp nodes, and I will show you guys how to make your character interactive or present it as an avatar with kinect ;)

This time the stream will take place on twitch.tv to avoid german copyright circus. Don't worry the recorded video will still be available on the youtube channel.

Stay tuned and see you on the vveekend!
