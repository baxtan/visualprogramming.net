helo patcherpeople,

look what i found: [openFrameworks 2013 survey results](http://blog.openframeworks.cc/post/60000217684/of-2013-survey-results). that made for an interesting read so i thought we can rip that off and have our vvvvery own. you in?

what struck me though is that they only got 368 respondents, which doesn't seem a lot. can we get more? here is the URL to promote:

looking forward to getting a better idea of who we're dealing with here all the time.
