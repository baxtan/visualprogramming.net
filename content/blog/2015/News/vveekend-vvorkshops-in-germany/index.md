As it turns out youtube live-streaming is banned only in Germany, it seems because they have an argument with a nice organization called Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte, or GEMA. They can go and fuck themselves sooooo much. Now because vvvv is a masterpiece of german engineering i can't really ignore that.
Unfortunately I don't have time now to set up a new profile on Twitch until the first session so I'm really sorry about that. (say hi to backwards thinking middle aged copyrights holding businessmen/lawyers) However next week I will stream from Twitch and upload the edited videos on Youtube.
For tech savvvvy and desperate german vvvv'ers I can suggest the wonderful world of proxies and VPN's according to ancient chinese traditions.

After 2020 internet will become the flying after 2001: despite of all the technological advancement it is somehow more expensive and harder to use than 10 years prior.
