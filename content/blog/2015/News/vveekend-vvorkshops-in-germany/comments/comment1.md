the problem with HoA is it requires a webcam or a desktop capture and you don't have much control over them either but it doesn't support proper rtmp streams from OBS where you have total control over different sources

also i know xsplit, vmix and wirecast has virtual webcams but neither of them free (or the free version is aweful) and the trial version of them wasn't convincing either. OBS is just the nicest piece of software for this according to my googling
