Ever thought about starting to learn programming with vvvv? Now is the time: From **April 27th to May 3rd** 2015 the 4th edition of the **NODE â€“ Forum for Digital Arts in Frankfurt/Germany** offers a series of 48 workshops that welcome everyone to join the vvvv community. 

The large number of workshops may be overwhelming to the beginner, so here is a selection of workshops recommended especially for the novice:

### Monday/Tuesday
If you've never touched vvvv or you did but are not yet very confident you should definitely first attend either the [german](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/vvvv-newbies-de-part-12-monday) or [english](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/vvvv-newbies-en-part-12-monday) *vvvv for newbies* workshop which comprises of a 4 x 3h introduction spread over two days and will provide you with the fundamentals. 

If you've already created your first projects but are still unsure about your practices attend [Bring Your Own Patch](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/byop-bring-your-own-patch) on tuesday afternoon.

### Wednesday
Once you're familiar with the basics you have the choice:
* dive into graphics: [Basic DirectX11 Shading Techniques](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/basic-directx11-shading-techniques)
* or animation: [Transformations](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/transformations)
* connect things: [Arduino & VVVVirmata](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/arduino-vvvvirmata)
* conquer the web: [vvvv.js - Extending your patching skills to the web](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/vvvvjs-extending-your-patching-skills-web)

### Thursday
Take a break and suck in some theory at the [symposium](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/wrapped-in-code-the-informed-body-symposium).

### Friday
In case you can't make monday and tuesday there is another very easy introduction into vvvv offered by the [Video Effects and Compositing](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/video-effects-and-compositing) workshop. Of course not as in depth as the two-day course and much more a focus on the specific topic but still very suitable for total newbies to attend. 

### Saturday
Further down the road you may want to apply what you've learned so far and check out [Cutting & vvvvolding Paper](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/cutting-vvvvolding-paper) or learn the basics of [VVVV.Audio](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/workshop/vvvvaudio). And in the evening get some inspiration for how your new skills could one day be applied by watching a series of [topofthepops audio-visual performances](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/concert/topofthepops-node-night).

### Daily
In case the practice ever gets too much for you, note that you can always fall back to nodes comfortable series of 50 minute lectures: [Of Patches and Projects](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/projects-vvvv-presentations/patches-and-projects). Besides you get to see an [extensive exhibition](http://node15.vvvv.org/program/the-informed-body-exhibition) on the forums leitmotif of "The Informed Body".
