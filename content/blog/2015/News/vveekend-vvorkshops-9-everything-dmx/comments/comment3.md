good news everyone it looks like vjc4's ISP pulled themselves together and started to serve the speed they're advertising so we can try again this workshop today at 4PM ART, 7PM GMT or 8PM CET

Update: nope fuck everything. now the problem was on my side fantastic engineers at MSI designed the microphone circuitry should be blamed now. and windows update. fuck'em! fuck technology!
