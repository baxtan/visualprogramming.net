#  UPDATE
So we will finally air this on Monday 18th January 5PM ART, 8PM GMT or 9PM CET. Nothing can stop us now, I'm in London with my beloved PC and Andres has his internet sorted out too! So tune in for some DMX magic!

I hope everyone had a good christmas! At today's vvorkshop {{< user "vjc4" >}} will show how to spice up your christmas decoration with DMX magic via building arduino artnet DMX interface, making a fixture from vvvv and DMX console patch from scratch.
