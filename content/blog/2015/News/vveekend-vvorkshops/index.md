You don't have anything to do on saturdays? even if you do you should rather sit in front of your viewing device and join the weekly online workshop series starting this week! It's food for your brainz, and a little jazz-up for the community!

![](logo_1.png) 

Now seriously we will discover random problems solved or not really solved in vvvv. These workshops will start from 4PM GMT and could be left on the whole night if the tutors and the audience are up for it. Every saturday we will tackle a specific topic to its extreme depths, starting out slowly and gently then combining all the computer ninja tricks you learnt from the interwebz (or in better case from this very series) like there's no tomorrow.

Workshops will take place on **Youtube Live**, this fantastic unique url  [](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8Vqigdbq5Gam_6dcGdNBw) is the currently empty channel where magic will happen. Also as with every posh live-streaming hype, audience will be able to talk with tutors through chat and will have a moderated reasonable interaction with them.

So first workshop will be about **Everything Rotation** where after 5 minutes of XYZ euler rotations we will dive into age of the universe amount of time quaternions and transformation matrices because apparently there is a general confusion around them.

SO in a nutshell stick your eyes on the first vveekend vvorkshops session on
**07. Nov. 2015 4PM GMT** 
[](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8Vqigdbq5Gam_6dcGdNBw)
and stay tuned for more info and videos!

See you on vveekend!

**P.S.:** there is a generic all-the-time open call for tutors or people want to show off their contributions and don't want to wait until NODE17, contact me on any kind of channel and we will arrange something. cheers!
