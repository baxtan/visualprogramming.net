Finally, about 13 years late, we hand to you an extensive documentation about one of vvvv's most unique strengths: [Spreads](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/spreads/index.html). We completely reworked the documentation on the topic and enhanced it with a lot of grayful images like this one:

It may seem a lot to digest at first, but take your time and use it as a reference whenever you're looking for an answer regarding a spreading topic. Specifically the listing of the most important [Spread Operations](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/using-vvvv/spreads/spread-operations.html) should come in handy for beginners to understand and give them an overview of what spreads are typically used for.

You may note that for a start we have left out more complex spreading scenarios. Still, if one gets a good understanding of those basics all further dimensions should be much easier to grasp. Feedback welcome.
