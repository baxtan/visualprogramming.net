Architecture and Media Art Studio in L.A is looking for a programmer to help us with a media wall art project located in a new City Hall lobby in northern California. 
 
Great opportunity for a programmer  interested in doing digital public art. 
 
The person we are looking for will be able to do the following:
 
-  Program the system and interface that allows for  people to upload text and images from their computers or mobile phones to the media wall. 

-  Program a system that fetches and gathers images and text from social media or from a website to display on the media wall.

-  Set up media server that receives and stores images and text 

-  Program the system that fetches images and text  from media server and displays them on the media wall in an artistic manner (we will work with the programmer to get the look and feel close to original concept) 
 

We are located near UCLA.
 
If you are an ambitious and motivated programer and  you are interested we would love to hear from you.
