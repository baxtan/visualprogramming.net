HeavyM is a software currently available on the web for downloading in its beta version since the 30th of September 2014 and it is free of charge. The goal is to make projection mapping accessible to all the creative people, with an easy-to-use and accessible tool. The application generates 2D real time animations for projecting them on volumes.

Download the current beta version : www.heavym.net

For more advanced projects, HeavyM is also compatible with Spout, in order to be used with vvvv.

No particular technical skills are required, a videoprojector is all you need to animate your live show, create an artistic installation, or bring your living room to life, thanks to the software.

From now on, its users will be able to simply and quickly set a interactive projection mapping, that means it can react to the sound of music.

Since the beta version was launched, the application counted more than 12 000 downloads in over 40 countries. The team built a community, made of loyal users that follow and support us.

They are currently running a Kickstarter campaign until June 30th 2015, in order to develop the most awaited features by their community of users.
