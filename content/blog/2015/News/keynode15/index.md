Just in case you live behind the moon...

...there was this [Forum for Digital Arts](http://node15.vvvv.org) going on last month. And because we have an incredibly professional team working behind the scenes you get an amazing coverage of many of the events delivered right to your browser of choice. 

Part 1 below is required watching for anyone who's into the world of vvvv. Part 2 is still a little bit more special interest as there we're talking about the future which can be confusing at times...

Massive thanks again to all the presenters, our intern  [famousenewmediaartist jeremy bailey](http://www.jeremybailey.net), the band {{< user "motzi" >}}, {{< user "dominikkoller" >}} and {{< user "zeos" >}} and sowieso everyone who is responsible for making this evening such a smooth experience.
