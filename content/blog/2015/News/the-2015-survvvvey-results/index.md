helo evvvveryone, 

sorry for being a bit late with this. We've planned to include the survvvvey results in [this years keynode](/blog/2015/keynode15) but ran out of time to prepare it. So now here you are:

## Some more...
Do you know the beautiful [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net)? We took all your answers to the "best&worst" questions and put them through it. This also reflects the overall mood quite a bit. (Stole that idea from the [Openframeworks survey results](http://blog.openframeworks.cc/post/108919370109/2014-survey-results). Scroll down to compare with their word-clouds).

For those interested in educational institutions that support vvvv here are the three most prominently featured universities where people learned vvvv:
* [Burg Giebichenstein - University of Art and Design Halle](http://www.burg-halle.de/en.html)
* [Muthesius School of Fine Arts Kiel](http://muthesius-kunsthochschule.de/)
* [University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt](https://www.h-da.de/)

Regarding wiki-page translations we plotted: How many people prefer to read wiki-pages in their primary spoken language rather than the english original versions. (In brackets: number of people who specified that primary language):
* chinese 100% (2)
* japanese 75% (4)
* korean 75% (4)
* spanish 73% (22) 
* italian 46% (13) 
* russian 40% (15)
* german 28% (127)
* french 16% (19)
Interesting with the french, isn't there this stereotype that they are not very much interested in other languages?

## Licensing
A few more details on licensing:
<!--{SPLIT()}-->
**Do you use vvvv in any professional/income-generating work?**
Yes 47.2%
No 52.8%
<!--~~~-->
**Have you worked on a commercial project where for some reason no license was bought?**
Yes 29.7%
No 70.3%
<!--{SPLIT}-->

Where, when asked **why no license was bought** the answer was mostly "because the project was to small to afford a license". But some of you gave a more..personal answer:
* "Boss is a cheap idiot that don't want to pay for licences."
* "because I've been working with fuckers, who don't give a shit at licences..."
* "Always tell my boss they sould buy a license for big projects. Boss is a dick."
Specifically the last one sounds quite unfortunate when i picture that literally. Word of advice if you find yourself in such a situation: Don't stop looking for more interesting people to work with. Yes, they can be very hard to find, but it is soo rewarding once you got them!
