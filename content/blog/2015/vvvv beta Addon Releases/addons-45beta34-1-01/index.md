helohelo,

this is just a minor bugfix release with 2 things in it:
* the OneDollarRecognizer helppatch is now fixed
* all Assimp nodes now got a version DX9 in order to no longer be confused with their DX11 counterparts

Please also make sure to read the beta34 release notes: [Addons 45beta34-01](/blog/2015/addons45beta3401)
