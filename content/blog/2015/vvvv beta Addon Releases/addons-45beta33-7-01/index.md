So what we got here? 

If you speak Photoshop have a look at [Hello Photoshop](/blog/2014/hello-photoshop-0) which explains a way to talk to a running photoshop instance on your network. Get images from it, send images to it and stuff... Anybody got an actual usecase for that?

For more details about whats new in this release please consult the change-log.
