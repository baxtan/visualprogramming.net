So helo, whats new here?

{{< box >}}
Note:
Kinect and Bullet nodes are both available in the addonpack and the DX11 pack. Until now this possibly caused confusion (red nodes) when you had both packs in use. 

**Now all Kinect and Bullet nodes in the addonpack have a DX9 version**. So from now on, no more confusion, but: If you have older patches where you specifically want to target the DX9 versions you'll have to update that manually now. Sorry for that but we cannot do that conversion automatically.

A few new nodes by {{< user "motzi" >}}, most notably the OneDollarRecognizer (2d). Make sure to check its helppatch.

And thanks to work by {{< user "velcrome" >}} and {{< user "microdee" >}} we were able to further reduce the list of nodes [missing in 64bit builds](https://vvvv.org/documentation/missing-in-64bit-builds).

Feel like supporting those efforts? See [the list of flattrable vvvv users](https://vvvv.org/404).
