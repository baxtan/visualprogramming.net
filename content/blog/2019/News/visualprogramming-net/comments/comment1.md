i like the sections LEARN and COMMUNITY - most important thing 

but they are only "vvvv gamma" - it's ok - but it should also called "vvvv gamma" not only "vvvv"

I also downloaded the Version: preview 975 from visualprogramming.net and there was no "Creating Executables" like the description said :-P
