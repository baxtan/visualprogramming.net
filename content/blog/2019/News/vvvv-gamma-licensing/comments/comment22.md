I re-read the discussion and changed my mind about not to tell about vvvv business model.

During last 10 years I made a path from vj and interactive developer (both employed and freelance) to a small business owner and I'm still involved in every project Ivan Raster software lab do. 
All that time I used vvvv for commerical projects. First, it was piracy, now I'm a legal user.

You can see amount of my licenses in the annual 'vvvv in numbers' charts from 2012 to 2018. [vvvv-in-numbers-2018](/blog/2019/vvvv-in-numbers-2018) Just replace Russia to bo27 or Ivan Raster. Of course I'm not the only one buyer from Russia, but I'm sure I have more than 90% of licenses here. How do you like it, Elon Musk?!

We are 4 people team and according to 2018 vvvv numbers, we buy&sell more than entire U.S. and China markets combined. That's noncence from economic point of view! That numbers shows something very wrong with current vvvv economic model.

I believe the major issue is the T.R.U.S.T model. It's unclear, messed and uncomfortable for commercial clients and it gives them nothing. All of you well know the "free version only for non-commercial use" notification and a way to remove it. 
The funny fact is you must stop using vvvv next second you remove the notification, no matter if you had pay for the license or not. When I told that to a friend of mine, who also run his own business, he asked me:
"Had anyone buy a license?" 
"Yes, some companies did" I answered
"You guys not a business, you guys a sekt."

While the T.R.U.S.T model is the key option for gamma (as well as for any other product), I bet it will work the same poor way it works for vvvv now, no matter 128 or 2560 euros per workplace, no matter 0 or 6% of product revenue.

I believe license model per PC and per workplace both possible at the same time and could be applied for the current vvvv version right now. Choosing the license should be about type of usage/final produ—Åt, not about what is vvvv/gamma are. 
99,9% of clients do not care if they run "APP.exe" or "APP.bat vvvv.exe /o "root_APP.v4p"/shutup"


Per PC license is great for: 
- a complex, custom, multimedia product existing in 1 or few copies (most of vvvv-based commercial products right now);
- a rental equipment (e.g. a multimedia server or a touchtable to be rented for events);
- a professional vj/artist who use personal PC with vvvv for commercial performances.
500 euro per PC is a good price.

Per workplace license is great for:
- vvvv as an engine for another software/framework (remember IRIS or MINT or our Architecture Lights Studio).
- a software like multitouch info-kiosks, indoor wayfinders, museum catalogs etc. The softwares that exist in 2-20 copies (average).
Even more than 2560 euros per workplace might be ok for that type of license in case we could sell any amount of copies.
In our case one of the major reasons why the ALS abandoned the further development was the vvvv licensing model. Now we losing huge market of multi-touch solutions mostly because of the current vvvv licensing model too.

Any product revenue will work only if you are the Google or Apple Store. Only when you sell software, you can count how many copies sold. In all other cases any revenue is fake. Announced 6% is fake.

I do care about the stuff above because I'm building a production envoriement, which requres stable standards for: 
- teaching new employes
- clear delivery terms 
- clear pricing 
- installation & bugfixing terms
- customers support services
- longterm warranty
I need a stable tool for that. It seems sekt-like business model won't suit my needs soon and I have to choose 'Plan B' for my growth. I prefer to pay more for more features, but not because of size of my wallet.
