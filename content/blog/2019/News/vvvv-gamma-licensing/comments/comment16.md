i never thought about the comparison to visual studio, but its true. vvvv gamma is rather a graphical visual studio thing than a competitor to unity. the last one is just wishful thinking in terms of features.

the proposed pricing only makes sense if the promises are kept i.e. advanced rendering engine, compile to exe, multiplattform.. including some vvvv core features like boygrouping

but its obviously a hen egg problem. an unfinished product will not attract customers hence generate little funding resulting in a slow development and an unfinished product tbc.

maybe not the best comparison but i wonder how sublime text did it. they startet with a free beta and later charge 80,-â‚¬. which is very attractive and therefore sublime spreaded like crazy around the globe. 

i bet a visual .net editor can be attractive too to the world but the pricing might be a killer. 

maybe its unclear what vvvv gamma wants to be and realistically can be in the short term. a unity competitor ? a replacement for vvvv beta ? or more of a .net editor ?

this rant is btw. not about us (wirmachenbunt) not willing to support. just some thoughts about the pricing implications. totally going in the same direction as velcromes post.
