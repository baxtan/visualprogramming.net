i wonder, what your thoughts were concerning contributions/contributors.

to me it looks a little (the least) discouraging to contribute stuff, since i read it like: as a freelancer, who is making a living with this stuff, i have to have a pro/editor plus license to be legally generating contribution content, aside from the commercial projects i work on (where the companies provide the license).

if i contribute for free, then one could maybe consider it non-commercial use, though it's rather not since i am working in a commercial context.
as soon as i plan to release it with a pricetag for non-commercial use, i'd have to set it to a sum to possible break even with a yearly pro/editor plus license. (which would drive the prices for contributions up a lot).

and here i'm not yet talking about contributions, which ship with the official release (in case there will be something like addonpack). will gamma come with vs style nuget license popup to distinguish between core and contribution nugets?
