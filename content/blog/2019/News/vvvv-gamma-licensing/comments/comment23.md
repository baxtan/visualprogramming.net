As someone who doesn't have / work at a studio currently using vvvv, I'll add my two cents. I would never choose a software that takes 6% of my gross revenue.

What's more, here's why I think for you it's a bad idea:

1) If the product is really large, what the client needs is support (and maybe customisation). Just sell that! That binds what you bill your client directly to their needs. As it is right now, support in the forum is great but you don't give companies the feeling that there's a guarantee for support.

2) If the product is not really large, don't try to get the 6% revenue - there won't be any. It's quite easy to tamper with numbers until there's 'no more revenue'. People will do that, TRUST hin oder her.
