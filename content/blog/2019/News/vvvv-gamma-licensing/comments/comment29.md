Thanks @joreg for time, patience and great discussion. After we cleared all misunderstandings, we found ourselves on opposite sides of ideological border. Here my thoughts about vvvv beta and vvvv gamma licensing as I understand them from my side of the border.

####  issue
vvvv beta and vvvv gamma are not multipurpose toolkits for wide-market, but very special professional tools for very specific market with few types of customers and business models and licensing should follow that. 

In my opinion, the T.R.U.S.T. model doesn’t work well for vvvv beta and I still believe that all the  upcoming improvements and advantages of vvvv gamma will be vanished by weaknesses of the T.R.U.S.T. model in its current state.  
I will use vvvv below meaning both vvvv beta&alpha and vvvv gamma. I believe the suggested model could be applied now for all versions.  

####  model
Instead of the T.R.U.S.T model I suggest to protect vvvv with Teamviewer alike model.
Just after the splashscreen there must be a pop-up: "Thank you for using vvvv. This is free version only for non-commercial use. To continue press OK to remove notification press REGISTER".

* OK will launch vvvv with no feature limits, same as now.
* REGISTER will open a dialog to enter a license number and a license key. This dialog could be also accessible via main menu. License number & key provided by vvvv group by email after a license payment (almost same as now). License number is the same as now and key is a code to crypt a license number.

Register will remove the pop-up and replace “free version only for non-commercial use” splash-screen with “commercial use. License No….”. Also there should be a dialog menu to replace vvvv splash-screen with a custom design.

####  licenses
For registered users I suggest 4 license options: 

# A PC license without protection = 500 euro* /forever 
# A PC license with a dongle protection = 650 euro* /forever
# Workplace subscription = 2 000 euro/yearly
# Enterprise subscription = 15 000 euro/yearly

(*) I suggest to keep volume discounts for PC licenses but simplify them to amount in a bulk instead of current progressive discounts

####  usage 
In my opinion, this simple system will work for everyone: 

* Educational and free/low-budget users will just need to click OK on startup or ask their assistants to click OK. That’s great for study, performances, individual artists/vjs, indie developers, few-days installations, art festivals etc. You have to click OK, but nobody see you clicking, no need to hack anything. 
* PC license is great for professional artists who do performances in person, for rental equipment like media servers and for commercial custom & complex multimedia installations that exist in one or few copies. Artist will confirm professional status. Rental equipment will work many times for many users and many clients. Production studio will sell PC licenses to their customers and it will be clear both for the production studio and for customer. 
* Workplace subscription is for professional developers and small studios which projects don’t match  the PC license. The subscription will allow you to use custom splash-screen and to use the same license number at any copies of your own software with no further questions from vvvvgroup. That’s why you have to pay annually while you're using vvvv at your projects. 
* Enterprise subscription is for big companies, who do a lot of stuff. The enterprise subscription will include all from Workplace, but for any amount of workplaces in a studio, plus custom supports terms from vvvvgroup. 

####  result
I believe this could do licensing much clear than current and much easier than suggested to gamma and will at least quadruple vvvvgroup revenue.
