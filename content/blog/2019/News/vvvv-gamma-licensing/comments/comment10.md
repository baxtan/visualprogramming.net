@woei good point. indeed this wasn't specifically adressed. and just as we support FOSS development, we gladly include "vvvv pack development" with the free use license. the thinking behind both is the same: by sharing sources or adding value to the eco-system in the form of packs (even if you then charge for them) you already contributed your share and don't have to pay for using vvvv for those cases. hope this clarifies.

regarding nugets our current thinking is that it will be very close to the visualstudio workflow. contributions to core are another issue, we still have to tackle. 

@velcrome regarding products: as the above says: it is Editor Plus for each developer working on the product and then 6% revenue after the first 5000â‚¬ per quarter. yes, this is charging twice for successful products. we'd prefer to offer a simpler solution here but since we're only getting started we think that it is reasonable to not only compare our offer with the biggest players on the market, when it comes to how they generate revenue. it is about diversivying income options for us. we could lose on our EditorPlus flatrate model that now allows a single license owner to create unlimited projects and on the other hand you say you'll have to pay much more than before. at this point it is hard to tell how things will work out so we try to be careful. wouldn't it be nice if the next [flappy-birds](http://www.businessofapps.com/data/flappy-bird-revenue/) was patched with vvvv and some of that revenue could flow back to the devvvvelopment?! if you have a specific idea for a product where you think our licensing is not competitive, please get in touch.

"If perpetually taxing F5 is already a downer" not exactly sure what you mean, can you rephrase this so we can make sure our intended terms were understood?

@texttext you're very vlcome but also your thanks go directly to the velcromes who pay for part of your joy.

@beyon    
"What about commercial projects with FOSS release of Gamma parts? Above with code only but maybe not assets/data?"
can you rephrase that? see "free use" for FOSS development.

"Will VL be embeddable in product as scripting language with the possibility to limit the available nodes?"
yes. licensing regarding this will be announced, when we have it available.

@bjoern there will be discounts for owners of existing vvvv licenses, we're not sure yet about additional early adopter discounts. regarding maturity: in many ways gamma is already much more mature than beta, in other ways not. obviously specifically regarding 3d/audio/video gamma will still be behind on launch. regarding "the competition", always depends what aspects you compare... in some respects vvvv will never be "fully featured" and we cannot keep raising the price with every feature we add..
