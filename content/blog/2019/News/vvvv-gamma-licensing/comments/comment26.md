I'm not suggesting the only $ stream to the devvvvs should be a low fee subscription with independent developers taking the rest.

High quality 'add ons' / libraries written by the devvvv team, including core parts of the VL experience (eg the difference between Beginner, Indie, and Pro) would / could be a significant part
