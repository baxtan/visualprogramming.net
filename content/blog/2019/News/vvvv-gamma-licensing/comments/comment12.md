@velcrome - for this to make sense you absolutely have to think about how to do executables on installations that are running long term, maybe tools to adjust the installation in some debug mode etc.

Point is, I think this should lower the cost for running installations
like when we did frickin 18 computers or something like that and every pc needed its own license, i think the license should be only for dev seats, as is the industry standard. 

This is the main thing that I hear whole community cry about for years, and seeing someone so deep into vvvv just turn around and say we actually do not want that is surprising to me honestly.
