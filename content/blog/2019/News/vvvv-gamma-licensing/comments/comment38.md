Just saying hi to keep hope alive for a licensing structure more embracing curious makers without a dime all over the world.

I am impressed how much of the side notes of this thread are actually starting to take shape out of the fog ([exe](/blog/2019/vl-exporting-an-application), .net core, xenko, c[o](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.OpenCV)ntrib[s](https://github.com/sebescudie?tab=repositories)).

F9 for the win. One can only fathom the possibilities of the generated c# projects yet, tooling for cloud and transcoding ahoi.

Surely, gpu accelerated 3d graphics are the missing [keystone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_(architecture)) for vvvv gamma at this point and it fills me with optimism that Virgile and the two bosses of vvvv GbR stepped up their optimism, aligning more with their staff, and joined forces in Berlin...

I just wanted to write a pun about even enduring Berlin in the winter, with its lead grey skies, but that is actually not giving justice to what you devvvvs embarked on:

The perilous quest of giving rise to the next generation of visual programming: by being close to .net and knowing a thing or two about high-level abstractions in data flow and records, you could empower many thousands of coders who never considered themselves coders by pairing them up with coders, who never considered themselves multipurpose, but know how to make a nuget. 
While currently facing a dwindling vvvv beta user base, it is easy to fail at this junction, if you don't manage to match talented patchers with talented nuget devs in win-win situations in vl as a symbiotic progression (maybe with a patch shop). 

However, your [Moscow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rr7QRYlZDc&feature=youtu.be) performance fills me with hope.
