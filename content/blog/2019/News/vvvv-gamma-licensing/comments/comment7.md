@u7angel Based on my licenses, I could count the estimate total and count how many licensed other companies bought in average. And your numbers confirmed my accounting. And the numbers are sad (at least for me).
Unfortunately, this discussion is about vvvvgroup's money, so it would be wrong to tell my counting in details here. I would like to avoid affecting their business.
