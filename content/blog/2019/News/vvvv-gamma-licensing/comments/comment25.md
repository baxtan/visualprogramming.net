@velcrome - That reads as super sensible to me and is so much more clear than the pricing at the top of this page.

A store / monetised nugets sound like a win to me, combined with low fee subscriptions for the masses.  Is that not how people make money online these days?  It's about customisation / personalisation / clarity I think?
