Being a non-commercial user, I really appreciate that I can use vvvv Gamma without limitations and that you do not have a "lite" version (with all the interesting features only in the commercial version :-) ).

Thanks a lot, I'm really looking forward to the executables-feature (and later xenko integration of course)!
