One more thing that just came to mind because I was reading [this](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vvvv-is-not-opening-throwing-up-some-error/17342/2) and [the topic](https://discourse.vvvv.org/search?q=7zip) comes up so frequently. Not to forget the never ending posts about missing dependencies.

To quote u7angel
{{< box >}}quote:who:
imagine what a beginner has to do and to know of, just to get vvvv up and running.

* downloading vvvv
* understand and install the addon pack
* understand and install packs and dx11 (usually)
* finding out about the setup and be surprised what else she/he has to install (7 things in total)
* and as a bonus quest, looking at a 2:30 minute splash screen, thinking vvvv just crashed

it is actually surprising people start learning vvvv after this.

Is gamma going to be susceptible to the same *errors*? 
Are you considering an [installer](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/still-vvvv-vl-taking-ages-to-open/17004/5)?
