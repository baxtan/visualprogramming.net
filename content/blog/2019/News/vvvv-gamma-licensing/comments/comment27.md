Hi devvvs, 
first, its important that you get some money form this hudge developpement.

BUT, i m sorry,  **whats the hell is that thing of a yearly or monthly subscription**, and updates accesible thruth money ??? 
we are going weird away from any idea of ethical prices... and a certain spirit...

an example: 
do i use Adobe ? No. And i will **never** use their products. Monthly subscriptions are just making people dependant and clearly forcing them to pay all the time, all the life...   **its not a fair way at all**.  i assmilate this type of model to ransom

for me, if subscriptions are obligated to have a software up to date and un-buggued (joreg ...  ;) ) , it will make me considering strongly not to put any time nor effort in VVVV gamma. I will simply run away from it. 

a subscription could feet a studio with some big regular cash, not at all freelancers doing  projects  1, 2 or 3 times maximum a year with little amounts from "clients".

the avaiblity to compile an exe shouldnt be understood as a weird and massiv distribution system, but the hability to construct software unbreakable (its the patch weakness) by user.

**6%**

Beside this, the 6% is a real good idea, if VVVV Gamma can compile exe. Its really ok, but I m not understanding of you can anticipate the 5000€ fee. It will lead to the same points with classical VVVVV beta licenses: not so much people giving money, and frustration for you also

**Coming back to this license, maybe you could consider an other way to do it:**

final compilation of the application could come with a registering key, delivered by VVVV group on internet. 

Means thats VVVV is hosting somehow the compilated project ? this key could be around 100 to 200€, and could authorize 3 or 4 computers max to use this compilated software, based on MAC adress approach. The independant developper, when compiling it, could enter number of MAC adress maximum to register. The price of a license for the end user could change with amount of Mac adresses. 

**OR... continuing on the idea, VVVV site could provide a shop**, hosting final developpements of its community. The 6 or 10 or 15% percents of the software could be taken directly, amount depending of the range of money the developper has given to his exe ( 20€, 100€, 600€, 1000€). The final exe, build for external computers ( MAC based system), would be transmitted by the compilator process to the shop, once validated by the user-developper. 
But this means a lot of work for VVVV group, to develop such a commercial plateform... dont know what it means in terms of law and rules neither...

**About "complain & client"**, a full license at 600€ is buyed by big clients, here in France in Theatre, its quite some money for little theatre troups. 100 or 200€ product licenses will certainly make a big difference and enables our little clients to pay the license. Wich is not actually the case.

**Perpetual licenses updates**

Considering the case of a perpetual license, to avoid rental/ransom, an update at a reasonnable price would be better. 

**Linux**

In this post, i didnt read anything about linux. wich is really something i m waiting for, to get out from this business model called windows. VVVV beta is the last tool that obliged to me to stay on windows.

Yours, sincerely

christoph
