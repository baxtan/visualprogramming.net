sorry for the delay. from some of the answers we got here, we had the feeling our proposal had been in parts quite missunderstood. to figure out where things went wrong i took to direct talks with some of the above. i'll get back with trying to resolve the missunderstandings for all. meanwhile please keep your questions coming if you're not sure about certain things.

but quickly @karistouf:
"whats the hell is that thing of a yearly or monthly subscription" it is one of the payment options people want. if you don't want it, you can stick to the perpetual option (see proposal), where you pay once and own forever (including one year of updates), just like it was before. does this make sense?

and if you read in the fine-print of the yearly subscription you see that our model is much fairer than other softwares subscription model as we let you keep using the last version when you cancel the subscription!

"Beside this, the 6% is a real good idea, if VVVV Gamma can compile exe. Its really ok, but I m not understanding of you can anticipate the 5000€ fee." to rephrase this because i'm not sure you understood this correctly: if you make a product and earn <5000€ per quarter it means you owe us nothing! if you make more than 5000€ per quarter, say 6000€, it means you owe us 6% of 6000-5000€. ie. 6% of 1000€ = 60€. did you understand it that way?

"... But this means a lot of work for VVVV group, to develop such a commercial plateform..." exactly, this is why we haven't embarked on this journey yet. but we're not ruling it out as a future option.

" a full license at 600€ is buyed by big clients, here in France in Theatre, its quite some money for little theatre troups. 100 or 200€ product licenses will certainly make a big difference and enables our little clients to pay the license." this is what we have added the indie and monthly-one-off options for, which allow you to get cheaper options for more fine grained periods than always a whole year. 

ps: please send me a mail so i can change your email.
