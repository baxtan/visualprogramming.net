Will these prices be valid from the first release on and/or have you considered some kind of early access pricing as known from games development? In other words do you consider gamma a mature (fully featured) product yet?

I know a lot can be done in vl already but when comparing gamma to the competition it seems to be somewhat short on features you'll get out of the box. Same goes for the features included / announced for the first release vs. what's planned for the future â€“ future has the edge.
