Hi joreg, 

well after reading your reply, i have the feeling its more a question of ideas, or ideological way to think things.

I follow the simplicity expressed by bo27. 

and i confirm you:

* i m **against** renting a license, i think this is a question of ethic, and i m not still understanding how the vvvv group arrived to it... updates for monthly or yearly subscriptors... really no, neither for indies nor pros. we need powerfull tools and GENEROSITY, to spread in this f*** universe some real good things.
* 
* the price of license in indies should no go more up. Updates should be automatically possible, without subscriptions, until you release a really NEW thing ( this means change your habit about versions, doing it every 2 years ith a big thing new, and not every 6 months)
* 
* i think if exe compilation is possible that my idea to make it available to everybody ( if the developper wants) trhuth a Gamma web hosting platform is opening things. This would enable some payement for you, in %, and increase the eco system and name of VVVV, wich is considered quite obscur, despite its a great tool. 
*
* bo27 is right about Splash screen its really a good idea. i m with him




I hope I answered well to your question. It would really be better to have a fluent exchange on Skype or something like that, i have the feeling writting is putting some difficulties in understanding 

sincerely yours

( and thank you for this great work you are doing since a so long time)
