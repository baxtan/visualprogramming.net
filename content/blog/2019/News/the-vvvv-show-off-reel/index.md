vvvv looks back on a history spanning almost 20-years of wonderful projects. Many are the first of its kind and have influenced and defined trends in creative coding, digital arts, projection mapping, and interactive installations.

Over time we've become so familiar with all of this, we forget that many people aren't.

To address this, we proudly present our first showreel:

This video is even safe to share with your friends.

See credits or Vimeo description for the full list of projects.
Thanks to everyone and happy projecting. We'll probably do this again next year.

Yours,
devvvvs
