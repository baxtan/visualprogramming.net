Thanks for eventually listening.

Just wish debates like that would be less tenacious. It never felt like joreg truely wanted the feedback, and instead just pressed an endless query of "clarification questions" to make it really labor intense just to be heard, and get a chance to stop vvvv from commercial folly. 

But yes, this proposal is something that can actually work. Happy about that
