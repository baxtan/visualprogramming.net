@bjoern to clarify, the main idea of the "free use for contribution development" is to encourage people to create, maintain and monetize contributions for vvvv. if someone can make an income like that, that is in our interest. therefore we don't charge a license for the time someone invests in creating contributions. 

such work obviously may overlap with work on commercial projects, in which case a license is still needed to cover the commercial work.
