Do you remember the time...

{{< vimeo "348602765" >}}

Like it was yesterday...and tomorrow is yet to come. Watch to the end... so NODE20 it shall be!

The video is also accompanied by a nice write-up of all activities on the nodeforum page:
[NODE17 - Designing Hope](https://nodeforum.org/activities/festival/node17-designing-hope/)

Once again many thanks to everyone who makes NODE possible and those who are working behind the scenes throughout the years to keep the spirit alivvvve and push for the next edition of the festival.
