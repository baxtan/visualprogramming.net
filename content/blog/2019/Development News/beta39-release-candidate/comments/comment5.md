very convenient it is, i hope this solves the installation terror in the beginner courses.
thanks for this.

from a professional point of view, there is only one question. we ship our projects with vvvv and all dependencies like packs. that's kinda difficult now since the packs folder is not a part of the vvvv folder anymore. is the intended workflow to add those packs with the root patch ? or would it be possible to have a config file to set the packs folder path ? that would be awesome. maybe even add that to the config.exe to minimize this breaking change.
