heavy patchers,

the time has come. as mentioned [previously](/blog/2018/the-road-to-gamma), one of the bigger things we have cooking is the preparation of VL.Xenko, a modern 3d engine for vl, based on the opensource 3d engine [Xenko](http://xenko.com/).

We've successfully finished [a project](http://oceanofair.com/) using what we have of VL.Xenko so far and we had great joy working with it. What we'll be able to offer with it goes far beyond what you've been used to when doing 3d graphics in vvvv. Still we have a bit of a way to go before we can comfortably release it to a wider public.

But!

As the always young, fresh and agile team that we are, you know that we often like to try something new. And so for bringing VL.Xenko to a public 1.0 release we want to offer you the following:

## The VL.Xenko Early Access Program
Consider this like a kickstarter for the latest hyped gadget, only that you don't have to wait for it for months and wonder if you get it at all. We want to share what we have at the moment with a small group of dedicated patchers who want to test-drive this early stage of VL.Xenko and be part of the design process we're going through to make VL.Xenko usable for everyone. 

True to the kickstarter analogy, this also involves the part where we are seeking for actual financial support to speed this thing up. Your participation in the program will allow us to closely cooperate with Xenko to get the best possible experience for vl users with it. Also it'll allow us to get support for some lighter tasks, like documentation and creation of demos, to free our core team for the more heavy tasks still pending. And finally your financial support will also allow us to bring some into this program who couldn't afford to be part of it but who we'd very much like to have on board anyway.

Bestcase: You have a project coming up that you'd want to realize with vvvv/Xenko. You become part of the early access program and together we'll make sure your project succeedes. This is not to say that we'll realize everyones projects, but we're confident that we can give you the skills to profit from the powers of vvvv/Xenko from...say day 3.

## The programs schedule
Here is to give you an idea of how we anticipate to run the early access program:

* Bring participants on board
* Introduce participants to status quo
** how to setup a project with Xenko gamestudio from scratch
** how to build custom entities/utilities in private vl documents, separate from project files
** how to texture-share to vvvv
** how to import assets
** how to use/write custom shaders
** working with materials
* Talk with participants one by one to understand their project needs
* Compile list of priorities for VL.Xenko
* Continuously update VL.Xenko, incorporating user feedback
* Help participants realize their projects
* Final node design phase
* Tutorials, documentation for public
* Public Alpha

## To consider
What you'll be able to do:
* windows/dx11/VR deployment
- everything lowlevel and some entitiy stuff. 
- access to all xenko stuff for self importing
see topics that were collected at LINK


What not:
* no mobile deployment
* no vvvv only workflow
* there is no instance noodles, or fieldtrip lib. gpu-particles, good shader coding is helpful, porting is possible and not too complicated

So for the price of 5.000â‚¬, here is what we're offering:
- Access to vvvv gamma
- Access to the private VL.Xenko nuget package
- Access to a private forum to ask your questions and give feedback
- Access to changelog in private forum
- A (~3h) introduction to VL.Xenko on the spot in berlin or via internet
- A 3h project specific consulting
- You'll be mentioned as sponsor of VL.Xenko on vvvv.org

(- any commercial project you finish with VL.Xenko within the program period is free. on the day we publicly release VL.Xenko normal licensing fees apply (see below).)

We're planning to run the program for 8 months and release VL.Xenko alpha1 to the public after that. This is an early estimate and we may need to extend the program as we see fit. The number of participants to the program is limited. We'll take a maximum of 10 paying members but are also planning to take up to 3 non-paying members (application to be announced).

If you say vvvv gamma is the way you want to be creating your projects in the future and mostly what keeps you from it, is a proper 3d engine, this is an opportunity to bring that future closer to you and ultimately to evvvveryone.
