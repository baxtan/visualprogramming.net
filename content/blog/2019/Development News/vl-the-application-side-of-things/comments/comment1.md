totally forgot about the following:
 
 Alt-P : Application Patch
 Alt-Shift-P : Definitions Patch
 Ctrl-P : Create Node At Cursor (Application + Definition on the fly)
 Ctrl-Shift-P : Create the Definition only


so basically. for all the mentioned shortcuts (including those in the blog post) work with the same idea:
 
         ShortCut     -> Some command on the application side
 Shift + SameShortCut -> Similar command on the definition side

@mburk:
also working on other things that we were certain are basic ingredients for an authoring env.

so yes, the feedback from link is still guiding us in prioritization and focus.
