sure. this was just the first most important step. note however that a breadcrumb ```
ape->wheel->rubber
```
will not be too helpful. you still would need to know which wheel. for that we'd need to be able to name the instances of the wheel on application side.

e.g. in the ape patch we'd give a "descriptive name" *front wheel* and get a bread crumb
```
ape->front wheel->rubber
```
