very cool.

can you add a call stack breadcrumb trail as well, so we don't need to go up and down the patch hierarchy just to find out which instance we are actually dealing with at any given moment?

as a clarifying use case: imagine having not only your ape, but also a ModelT and a 4x4, all relying on the same definition of wheel. when looking at any wheel, you would want to know which car's wheel you are actually dealing with. as of now, this information is only accessible by actually navigating up and drilling down again, instead of getting that info straight.
