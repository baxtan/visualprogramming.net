@velcrome yes, making a new project file is the easiest. most vvvv/vl projects are tiny and you only need to set the dependencies. c# files get listed automatically with the new project format.

about the Xenko.Core.Mathematics reference, you can use the official release one, the specific version shouldn't have an impact: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xenko.Core.Mathematics/3.1.0.1
