Great progress! The help browser is growing up fast :)) Can't wait for it to reach adulthood.

Also wondering whether you're open to external educational contributions (tutorials, explainers). Might be offered as curated content in a way that makes it known it's third party. 

Embedded YouTube player would be a great plus too. That way the download won't become big because of video files. However it should remain an option to have all available offline. Maybe an installer option?
