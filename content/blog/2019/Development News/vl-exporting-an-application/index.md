With the release of [vvvv gamma 2019.2 preview](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2019.2-preview) it's now finally possible to create standalone applications out of any vvvv patch.

{{< youtube "Pj1QVqM0QJA" >}}

The steps to create an application are as simple as this:
- Download and install [vvvv gamma 2019.2 preview](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2019.2-preview)
- Open the patch you wanna have as an executable
- Open the application exporter by pressing F9
- Press export and voila you have an executable which runs on any Windows 10 machine

To learn how to deal with referenced assets, read [Exporting Applications](https://vvvv.gitbooks.io/the-gray-book/content/en/reference/hde/exporting.html) in the gray book.

So please try it out with your projects and report any findings in the forums or the chat.
