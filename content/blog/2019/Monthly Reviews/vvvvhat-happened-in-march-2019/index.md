it is out!

as promised, we [released vvvv gamma](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) into the wild. not exactly the full 1.0 release we had hoped for, but at least as a preview that you can download and testdrive. we're eagerly awaiting your feedback and bugreports in [the dedicated gamma forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/gamma) and are regularly updating the download link in the announcement post with the latest preview release.

one of the freaky new features recently introduced in vl are [input and output pin-groups](/blog/2019/vl-input-and-output-pin-groups). when previously the usage of dynamic pin-groups required writing c# code, it is now a breeze to add them to your own nodes with just a few clicks.

and a [release candidate](/blog/vl.opencv-release-candidatere) is up for our computer vision library VL.OpenCV, which is now using latest OpenCV 4 and comes with a lot of howto patches that you can conveniently access via the help browser. note that when using gamma, VL.OpenCV is already included, no need for a separate nuget-install!

next steps? polishing gamma to a proper 1.0 release by holding on to our [roadmap](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/roadmap.html).
