so here we are, 

in the middle of the summer hole and bad news first, we still haven't come to terms with a proper update on the 2 last remaining features for vvvv gamma 2019.1 that are (as mentioned before) better tooltips and executable export. good news, there is progress:

*big deal: .vl files compiled to .dlls*

besides, our work on the node-library is doing well. currently in the works and already available for testing are: 
* [VL.Devices.Realsense](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-devices-realsense/17685/)
* [VL.Devices.Kinect2](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-devices-kinect2/17516)
* [VL.Devices.Nuitrack](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-devices-nuitrack/17625/)

so grab the [latest preview](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) and give those and everything else a spin. this is really a good time to get into vvvv gamma and report your findings. mentioned already last month, but this deserves a recall: be sure to watch the latest [design pattern video tutorials](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/model-runtime-editor-design-pattern-intro-0-6/17597) by {{< user "dottore" >}}, they'll get you going builing proper apps with vvvv as has not been possible before!
