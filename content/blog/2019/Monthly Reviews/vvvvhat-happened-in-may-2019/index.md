the results are in!

of the [2019 survvvvey](/blog/2019/the-2019-survvvvey-results). bottom line: you're all the same, you haven't changed a bit. comforting..

if you still haven't gotten anything better to do in summer, like me, meet your patcher friends at LINK, this time organized by longtime patch-head {{< user "StiX" >}}. sign-up here: [link-summercamp-application-extension](/blog/2019/link-summercamp-application-extension). verymuch looking forward to this!

and still [vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) is going strong. none of the bigger missing parts are in yet, but we're constantly releasing bug-fix releases. every report is verymuch appreciated! new tooltips and exe-export are still in the works and they'll be coming as promised.
