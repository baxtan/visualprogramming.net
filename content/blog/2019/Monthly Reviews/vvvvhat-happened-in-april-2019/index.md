have you tried it yet?

it is still hot and [regularly updated](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview)! if you haven't yet, maybe the [latest IOBox update](/blog/2019/vl-the-big-iobox-update) convinces you to give it a go. massive thanks to everyone who is testing and giving feedback and reporting bugs. very much appreciated!

while we're onto fixing the still most pressing bugs we're now concentrating on 3 final things we mentioned in the [roadmap](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/roadmap.html): tooltips, executable export, documentation. these are the areas where we're hoping to have something to show next. 

meanwhile if you have thoughts on working with Kinect2 in vl, [please let us know](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/vl-devices-kinect2/17516).

and thanks to {{< user "u7angel" >}} we have recordings of a recent [vvvv gamma workshop](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/particles-with-their-own-behavior/17507/2), a [presentation about Ocean Of Air](https://youtu.be/0laS6O0ET0w) and a [VL.Xenko demo](https://youtu.be/KgkdLZg7BZw).
