Finally,

a new [vvvv gamma preview](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) is out including the promised [tooltip rework](/blog/2019/vl-tooltips). Please help yourself to a fresh copy, test and report your findings. Up next as promised: executable export. And I'm happy to report that we're back in the game! After a major internal rewrite of the backend, which became necessary because we found a last minute showstopper shortly before we wanted to release a few months ago, we're now back where we were: We can export most patches/projects to an executable at the click of a button. It is painless and gorgeous and we can't wait to share it but still a few things need sorting. Meanwhile, here is how it looks at the moment:

At the same time, when our team is running in overdrive to make all the pieces fall into place we get people wondering [Is vvvv dead yet?](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/is-vvvv-already-dead/17735/) which swiftly turned into the 17th of the [most active topics](https://discourse.vvvv.org/latest?order=posts) of all times...

Speaking of activities, here what's happening in August and September in Berlin: 

* Every 2nd thursday of the month: [Patching Circle](/blog/patching-circle) - a hands-on vvvv self-help group
* Every 4th tuesday of the month: [vvvv meetups](https://gettogether.community/vvvv/)
* Always before each of the above: [Free introductions to vvvv gamma](/blog/2019/free-vvvv-intro-workshops-this-summer-in-berlin)
* 5 dates: [Full day workshops on different topics](/blog/:vvvv-gamma-beginner-workshops-in-berlin-this-summer)
...to be continued in the months ahead

If you wanna help, please spread those news, run meetups, patching circles or workshops in your own city and let us know about them. And also, if you have a moment for brainstorming, please help us with this [Call for tutorial topics](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/call-for-tutorial-topics/17769).

## Contributions

Not so much on the contribution front last month, except one outstanding piece by {{< user "dottore" >}}:
