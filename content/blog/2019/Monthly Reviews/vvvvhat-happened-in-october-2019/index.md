So another month passed,

and the promised executable export from vvvv gamma is still not available. Bummer, but all we can say is, this is not how it was planned! We got caught up in a few things. November it shall be, most definitely...Still be sure to always test with the [latest vvvv gamma preview](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) which we're continuously updating. Also the first 3 beginner tutorials are now available:

* [Randomwalk them Circles](https://youtu.be/rxN-9GR4GjI)
* [Playing with Truchet Tiles](https://youtu.be/fjLn0qdXD-w)
* [Creating a Simple Drawing App (with Undo!)](https://youtu.be/MSfxqHI2y-M)

and besides those here is a growing [playlist of HowTos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBTgwgsWWcT-G9lk-IlKLkGZJ9NnXcuBV). Hope this can finally get you started proper.

Also we're making good progress on our way to integrating the Xenko 3d engine with vvvv gamma and we've announced an [official partnership with Xenko](/blog/2019/vvvv-meets-xenko).

On the beta front we have a [release candidate](/blog/2019/beta39-release-candidate) out. We're very happy about your feedback that helped us get rid of many buggers before we call it a release. As of this writing we're quite positive this can now happen soon.

[Teaching Patching](/blog/2019/teaching-patching-a-mini-conference) happened and it was great! You can [watch the whole stream](https://youtu.be/8JH1qdbfOpo) to hear interesting accounts of people involved with teaching vvvv. On day two we got to talk more about how we could take this further. Current developments are organized on [github](https://github.com/vvvv/TeachingPatching)...

And if you haven't seen it yet, a short video documentation about the last edition of the NODE festival was just released. Good reminder of the cozy time we had there:

## Binge potential:

- **[vvvvTv on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu-xqv-TLwv6L0An7MJJA5A)** is now prepared to collect all future beta and gamma related videos. Expect tutorials, howtos, releasenotes and live streams there. 
- the **[vimeo group 'vvvv'](https://vimeo.com/groups/vvvv)** was initiated by {{< user "phl" >}} ages ago for which we wanna say thankyouverymuch. He now handed it over so we can manage it from our end. Expect a stream of the latest fine projects of patchers worldwide.
