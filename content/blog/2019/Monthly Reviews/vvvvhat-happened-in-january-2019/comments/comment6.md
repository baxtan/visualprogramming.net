whaaat?
sorry but this is kinda a last nail in the coffin. show me any serious authoring software not having multiple windows, or at least multiple sub windows inside a proper one (not only tabs). This is not a "more requested feature" or a "usability extra" this is something I'm expecting from any half decent professional authoring environment. People should take this granted. I wouldn't consider my software anywhere near releasable without it. It would be at least as crucial for me as undo or saving files. I know it's painful to do with the library you're using for UI, and it's not as exciting to develop as other cooler features, but you guys have time, this problem have been solved countless many other times before, just grind your teeth and do it, you're better developers than this.
