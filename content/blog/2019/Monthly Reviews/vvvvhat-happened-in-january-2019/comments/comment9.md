there are libraries out there taking care of this. what's stopping you hosting your Skia renderers in these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLkHZh5Mbx8
or this is a more bare-bones example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB4s2LpYHqc
it even runs on linux (using avalonia)
even Imgui can do it which supposed to be a debugger user interface but got blown out of proportions recently:

so ain't no more excuses! especially if you want people to pay for your software!
