@domj your ui looks amazing. and yes this is also more like what I had in mind for patching. but in the end we'll want both: multiple tabs in multiple windows and being able to split-layout each window. and temporary overlays..and browserlike navigation.. we have this planned as a bigger step that's why unfortunately it still has to wait a bit.
