here we go, 

clickclickclick. [2018 is numbered](/blog/2019/vvvv-in-numbers-2018) and we're now heading towards the biggest release in vvvv history. as announced previously: [vvvv gamma](/blog/2018/the-road-to-gamma).

we're still on track regarding our [roadmap](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/roadmap.html) and here is a little status report:
- UI rework is well under way, looking smooth and shiny
- spreadable IOBoxes are a thing, need refinements
- editing patches is no longer blocking renderers
- we simplified the document structure to have a better default workflow
- tons of helppatches are in the works
none of these are in alphas yet, but if things go well, they should land soon.
- and not part of the initial release, but work is also progressing on integrating xenko...

while you're waiting and haven't yet, please fill out the [2019 Survvvvey](https://goo.gl/forms/g3t6gwSwUfZwMOyd2)!
