Finally,

as promised for some years now, we have shipped [Executable Export](/blog/2019/vl-exporting-an-application) with **[vvvv gamma 2019.2](/blog/2020/vvvv-gamma-2019.2-preview)**. Try it, it is just a click and you get a standalone program out of your patch, which you can run on any Windows 10 PC. 

Wanna know how we do it? Read all about it in the article with the poetic title: [New Roslyn based backend](/blog/2019/vl-new-roslyn-based-backend). And while we're techical, if you're so inclined you may also be interested in [our talk at DotNextConf](/blog/2019/vvvv-at-dotnextconf-moscow-video) in which we presented vvvv to an audience of .NET developers who had never heard of us before. 

To give them an easy way to explore vvvv we also created this preliminary new website with a focus on vvvv gamma: [visualprogramming.net](/blog/2019/visualprogramming.net) 

But just before that we've also released the latest and greatest of the beta series: **[vvvv beta 39](/blog/2019/vvvv50beta39)** which now comes with goodies like a WebSocket client node and PBR (physically based rendering) shaders and of course an up-to-date version of VL.

Aaaand if you're interested in our progress with Xenko (3d rendering for vvvv gamma), make sure to watch the [live-stream of our last berlin meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhzEwgdCbGo) where {{< user "tonfilm" >}} and {{< user "everyoneishappy" >}} demonstrate the status of VL.Xenko ShaderFX.
