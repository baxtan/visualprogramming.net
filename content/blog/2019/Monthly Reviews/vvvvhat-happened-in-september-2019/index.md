September,

didn't make it. But it looks quite good for October: We've shown it at recent meetups in Hamburg and Berlin. Ready your patches, because it is here, it is gorgeous and it takes only one click. Executable support is ready and you will be able to test it on your own rather sooner than later. Call it a game-changer or just another thing you didn't ask for. Either way, no need to pray, it is going to stay. Watch [this space](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview).

But first! We decided with vl being in quite good shape now, we're going for a beta39 release. It will come with one of the longer awaited features: an installer that takes just a few clicks to get vvvv beta up and running, including the addonpack! Expect a release candidate on one of the earlier days of this already new month.

Our first round of [short](/blog/2019/free-vvvv-intro-workshops-this-summer-in-berlin) and [long](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-beginner-workshops-in-berlin-this-summer) vvvvorkshops on gamma went smooth. So smooth in fact, that we're going to continue with them. We already have the dates for the upcoming free introductions announced and we'll soon add six dates for full-day workshops before end of the year:

**Upcoming dates**
* October 10-13: [vvvv workshop in Timișoara, Romania](/blog/2019/vvvv-workshop-in-timișoara-romania)
* October 18, 19 and 23: still to be announced full-day workshops in Berlin
* October 22: [Free vvvv gamma intro workshops](/blog/2019/upcoming-free-vvvv-gamma-workshops-in-berlin) followed by [vvvv meetup #14](https://gettogether.community/events/1755/vvvv-berlin-meetup-14/)

And one more: [Teaching Patching - a mini conference](/blog/2019/teaching-patching-a-mini-conference): Please forward this to anyone who could be interested in helping us improve education of and with vvvv. If you have experience, we'd like to here from you! Come join us for 2 days of cozy talks and help us position vvvv for the years to come!
