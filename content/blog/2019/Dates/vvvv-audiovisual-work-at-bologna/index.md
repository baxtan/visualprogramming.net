Hi all,

next Saturday I will be performing a generative work entirely done in vvvv, during an experimental electronic festival in Bologna <http://www.ecn.org/xm24/evento/bologna-elettrica-2019/?instance_id=37718>

The midi patches to external synths have been created with midi patches created in VL.
The video part is created with the great Instance Noodles pack, playing with sprites and lines @60fps.

After the improvisation there will be an open discussion on the software vvvv. 
It would be great if one of you guys will be there to join the discussion. 
In total I have got 90 min for the live show and open talk.

Drop me a message if you happen to pass by! {{< user "ddf" >}}
ciao
