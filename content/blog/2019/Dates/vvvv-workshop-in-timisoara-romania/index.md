Our workshop is titled: **Afraid of coding? Try visual programming with vvvv!**

In this workshop, we'll be introducing you to the visual programming environment vvvv gamma. If you've always wanted to create interactive games, installations or presentations but the coding it involves just doesn't feel right for you, then give vvvv a chance.

Instead of writing code, vvvv is using a more visual paradigm that doesn't involve lines of abstract text and therefore may be more appealing to you. But make no mistake, this is still serious programming. In the end, you can achieve the same results as with traditional programming.

After introducing you to the very basics of drawing and animating 2d primitives, we'll be talking about your ideas to find out what you're most interested in creating. From there we'll be showing you what you need to achieve your goals!
