Project XO is a project by New Movement Collective from London. In collaboration with Fenyce they developed an exoskeleton for experimental use in a dance piece. Luca (Fenyce) developed the control software in vvvv and Simon Haenggi (Visualpilots) is joining them to work on the production of the dance piece for the final show in April 2020.

This Friday 1st Nov you can see the system in action for the first time at a public preview session at Tate Britain, London.
It's a free event and the show will be on regularly from 6pm - 9.30pm
