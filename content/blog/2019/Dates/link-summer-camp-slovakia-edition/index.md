Hi everybody!
Since I missed meeting the best community this summer, I decided to organize Link summer camp in Slovakia!

**Application form:**  [](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1msDePnoVfAl9gCTMcZvBLj60c57-vGEv-Va9npP4pb0/)

I found great place for the camp, 1 hour of public transport from Bratislava.

The summercamp is not like an academy or workshop. You are not coming to learn. Here you are coming to share and spend quality time together while bringing forward your developments and ideas for future developments.
Wednesday is arrival day, and Thursday morning we are starting to work on our projects, so you need to be ready by then!
Capacity for guests is 25 people, so some of you unfortunately might not get in.

There will be DIY breakfast table ready for you every day, lunch and dinner cooked so you can patch away.

There will be also night program involving projectors and speakers! You will have opportunity to show off your live patching skills.

Also if you cannot attend for the whole time, join us on the public Saturday.

In a nutshell:

40km from Bratislava
180â‚¬ with all food and drinks inclusive
Everybody gets a bed!
