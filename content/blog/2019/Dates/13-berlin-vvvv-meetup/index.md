*Unrelated: How patching looked like in the olden days...*

It is the **4th tuesday of the month** again. Tomorrow!

That's why we're going to meet up and share some vvvv stories and drinks at the fine Brüll & Kraus in Rixdorf, Neukölln.

We'd love to hear from you: If you have something to show or talk about, please do so! Bring your projects, demos, works-in-progress and show us what you're patching with!

Also expect a little live-demo of the new export feature of vvvv gamma and another nifty new little feature...  

**Free vvvv gamma introduction**
Wanna get a taste of the all-new vvvv gamma? Join us already from 6pm to enjoy a 2 hour introduction to the future of visual programming!

If you feel like, please rsvp on our [Gettogether](https://gettogether.community/events/1754/vvvv-berlin-meetup-13/) page!
