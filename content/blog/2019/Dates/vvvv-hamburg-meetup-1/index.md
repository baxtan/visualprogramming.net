Hamburgers!

For the first time in world history (?) there'll be a vvvv meetup in your parutiful city. We'll be hosted in the workshop of The#Brake! There'll be a projector and drinks, that is all we need to get cozy.

We're happy to have long time vvvv users [DECODE](https://legacy.vvvv.org/businesses/decode) demo one of their latest projects. But there'll be enough time to hear more, so please bring your projects and show everyone what you're patching on!

From our side expect a little update on latest developments regarding the [vvvv gamma preview](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview)

If you feel like, [please RSVP](https://gettogether.community/events/2240/vvvv-hamburg-meetup-1/).

Looking forward to seeing you!
