Here we go again. This comes late but better late than never.

Next tuesday we meet again at the lovely retune studios in Berlin and hang out together.

This time we'll have a live performance by longterm vvvv user and visual artist crew {{< user "kopffarben" >}}. They have been long on tour in many cities. Now its time to say hello to the vvvv community and we'll have a look behind the patches.

After a long time of silence, there will also be a glimpse into the future by the devvvvs with short work-in-progress demos of things from the [VL roadmap](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/roadmap.html). Namely the state of executable export and tooltips re-imagined.

Still as always, feel free to bring your project/notebook/questions or whatever you want to share with the community. We have space and time for spontaneous discussions and presentations!

If you feel like, please rsvp on our [ Gettogether](https://gettogether.community/events/1591/vvvv-berlin-meetup-10/) page!
