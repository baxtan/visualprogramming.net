Once a month, every second thursday, we're hosting a "patching circle". Please join us for drinks and patches if you...

* ...are stuck somewhere with a project and could use some advice
* ...are just getting started and want to know what it`s all about
* ...just want to click yourself away in a patch-friendly atmosphere

vvvv devs and other members of the community will be there to help and share their experience.
Wipperstraße 13 is our new space - for asking questions, collaborating and keeping yourself on your personal level of [superhuman programming skills](https://www.xkcd.com/323/)!
