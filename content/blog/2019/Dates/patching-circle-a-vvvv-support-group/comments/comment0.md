Hi Rosi 
Greetings also from Ale, he said, he loves your Pictures of the patchingCircle.
I like the concept of the patching Circle but I'm a little confused about the time

regarding on this blogpost
[free-vvvv-intro-workshops-this-summer-in-berlin](/blog/2019/free-vvvv-intro-workshops-this-summer-in-berlin)
there is a free vvvv gamma workshop from 6-8pm
and afterwards patchingCircle starts @8pm with openEnd - did I got it right?

Here its written:
When Thu, Aug 8th 2019 - 20:00 until Thu, Aug 8th 2019 - 20:00 
its a little bit confusing for me

Greetings
