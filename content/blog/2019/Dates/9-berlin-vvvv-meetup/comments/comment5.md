Unfortunately not the whole thing was recorded but you can piece somewhat piece it together:

1) Virgil (current main developer of Xenko) presented Xenko with demo of the editor and showing how Xenko gives you a lot of options when it comes to the pipeline. Also discussing the transfer to Open Source in the effort to make Xenko relevant in competition to Unreal & Unity and also about building the required community and how they plan to transfer Xenko under a non profit organization (correct me if I'm saying anything wrong here) to make ensure it stays open and doesn't fork into a paid updated and stale open version. The vvvv integration was discussed only briefly but in general it is viewed as a great contribution for Xenko as well as visual programming is a fairly requested feature. Most improtantly Virgil is now leaving Japan for Berlin, and therefore will spend much more time with vvvvgroup which should accelerate the whole VL.Xenko endeavour.

2) I talked about Sch√©ma and made a recording. Here's the whole thing except for a few cuts of technical issues: https://youtu.be/_oqonrkE3xU

3) Dottore talked about his VL reference implementation of the Model-Runtime-Editor pattern. And since he already did the hard work of recording videos about each one of his examples, you will probably get all if not more information by watching those.
