Here are some good news: 

We got a new space in Davids and Stefans new office in Berlin that gives us finally the chance to plan our program more ahead. The best thing: the space is not only our office space, it is also particulary designed to host workshops and meetups. We will start a workshop and meetup series this summer in a more or less formless way. About the vvvv program you will be informed here and via different social media channels. We do not have an official website for the new space yet (working on it -> you will not miss it for sure), but you can be informed on other meetups groups, FB and the NODE channels.

##  July 23rd 2019. Meetup time is 20h!
This is the Meetup for vvvv interested open minds based in Berlin or visiting us in Berlin. Its a meeting point for creatives and visual developers, interactive media, digital art, technology and design enthusiast. We are open to anyone who wants to join, no matter if you are a vvvv expert or beginner, a famous or breadless artists, a designhead or technologist, a piano player or techno musician. We are especially open for newcomers and curious beginners and we try to make this meetup as diverse as possible but with a focus on vvvv and VL.

##  New to vvvv? Get an introduction workshop
Each meetup is preceded by a 2 hour free introduction to vvvv for everybody who is curious about the software and the creative possibilities that come along with it. After some food we go over to the meetup with presentations. See separate blogpost!


##  Do I need to know vvvv or vl to join this meetup?
No, absolutely not. The presentations will be about projects, patches, plugins, contributions, or simple add ons made with or for vvvv, but you do not need to know it to enjoy the meetup.

##  What is going on at this meetup?
You come, grab a drink and listen. You grab the next drink and talk. We have one or two announced presentations followed by one or two spontaneous presentations by anyone who brought something to show... We have space and time for spontaneous discussions and presentations! The focus should be in the processes, the decisions and the mistakes that occur during the development of an idea. Submissions are welcome. Please drop us a line.
