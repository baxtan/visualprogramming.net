привет Moscow!

We're happy to announce a series of vvvv happenings in Moscow on November 8 and 9 in collaboration with [](http://migz.ru). Together with {{< user "elias" >}} I'll [be in town](/blog/2019/vvvv-at-dotnextconf-moscow) and here is what we have planned:

## November 8th
### Free Introductory vvvv gamma workshop
[vvvv gamma](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) is the all-new version of vvvv. Whether you've been using vvvv beta so far and see its limitations, you want to take first steps in VL (applicable to beta and gamma) or you've always wanted to try vvvv for the first time: This workshop is for you!

In this 2h course we'll give you a taste of what it is like to work with vvvv gamma. We'll guide you step-by-step through creating your first little programs and show you how to export them as standalone executables.

When: 6pm to 8pm
Where: to be announced
