Latent Being is the new site-specific installation by Refik Anadol, 
pioneer in the aesthetics of artificial intelligence. 
The work responds to the cathedral-like concrete vastness of Kraftwerk, 
a former East Berlin powerplant. Visitors will walk through the four-chapters of the immersive, 
interactive environment, in which data relating to the city, 
the architecture and the visitors will be transformed into hallucinogenic, 
large-scale LED screen paintings. By using a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm 
to create this interactive AI-human constellation, 
Anadol challenges our perception of ‘space’ and our relationship with AI machines.
