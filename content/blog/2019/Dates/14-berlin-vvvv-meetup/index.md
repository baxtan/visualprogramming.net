*Excerpt of latest work by Takuma Nakata*

Here we go again!

As every **4th tuesday of the month** we'll meet again coming tuesday at the cozy NODE Institute in Rixdorf, Neuk√∂lln.

This time we'll have a live-connection to the other side of the globe from where fellow patcher Takuma Nakata will tell us about his latest work. He writes:

{{< box >}}
Hi I'm Takuma Nakata, Interaction Designer based in Kyoto Japan. With this OOOO I'm gonna talk about how I design an Interactive installation using vvvv with design perspective.

Additional: I'm personally not a coder, really bad with math, but still I can add interactivity to design by using vvvv, which is great since it's visually understandable.

I am an [Adobe Creative Residency](https://www.adobe.com/about-adobe/creative-residency.html), as an Experiential Designer. I'll talk what it's about, and try not go too deep with vvvv.{{< /box >}}

We'd also love to hear from you: If you have something to show or talk about, please do so! Bring your projects, demos, works-in-progress and show us what you're patching with!

And you can expect a little live-demo of [RCP](https://github.com/rabbitControl/RCP) that will be shipping with [upcoming beta39](/blog/2019/beta39-release-candidate)...
