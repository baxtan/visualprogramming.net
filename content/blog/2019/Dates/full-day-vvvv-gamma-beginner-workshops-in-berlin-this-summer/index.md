helo evvvveryone,

the all new vvvv gamma is finally [getting into a shape](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) where it can be your loyal compagnon in many ways. Therefore, in addition to our [free introductory workshops](/blog/2019/free-vvvv-intro-workshops-this-summer-in-berlin), we're also offering the following series of workshops to get you going proper:

## Getting started with Computer Vision 
With easy access to the computer vision library (OpenCV) and depth cameras (Kinect, RealSense,...), vvvv is a loyal companion for prototyping your computer vision applications and installations. With its no-code user-interface it allows you to quickly achieve your goals with just a few mouseclicks. Applying video filters, detecting motion and even using latest machine-learning powered techniques like YOLO, to label things in a video stream, becomes accessible to everyone.

**Who is it for?**
This workshop is for creative coders, professionals, students, designers and scientists, who want to learn a new way to analyze and sense realtime video images and get to know computer vision techniques.

**You will learn how to:**
- Work with the visual programming environment vvvv (gamma)
- Use the powerful computervision library [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) in vvvv
- Use different cameras as input devices
- Apply filters to video or still images
- Detect motion in images
- Do background subtraction for tracking
- Detect things in images with [YOLO](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/12/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv/)
- Batch-process still images

**Date**: 9. August 2019
**Time**: 10am to 5pm
**Hosts**: joreg (vvvv group co-founder and developer), David Brüll (Studio David Brüll and NODE Director)
**[Tickets](https://nodeforum.org/announcements/workshop-getting-started-with-computer-vision/)** for Getting started with Computer Vision{{< /box >}}

![](GenerativeDesign.png) 

## Getting started with Generative Design Alogrithms
Compose your own generative graphics without writing a single line of code and let your computer do what it is good at: randomness and repetition. After you set up your data flow program with the visual programming environment vvvv, lean back and see how your visuals grow in real time. Export these 2D generative graphics as vector files.

**Who is it for?**
This workshop is for creative coders, students, media artists and designers, who are interested in using computational techniques in their own practice.

**You will learn how to:**
- Work with the visual programming environment vvvv (gamma)
- Apply the principles of condition, repetition and randomness
- Generate patterns mimicing nature
- Create 2d graphics and animations
- Export graphics to .svg and .pdf

![](PhysicalComputing.png) 

## Getting started with Physical Computing 
Reading data from sensors to control lights and motors connected to a computer via an Arduino, is a breeze if you know how to. The same is true for working with data transfer protocols like OSC, MIDI, MQTT and DMX/ArtNet. Learn all this without the need to write any code, by using the visual programming environment vvvv.

**Who is it for?**
This workshop is for creative coders, students, media artists and makers who want to learn how to communicate between computers and devices.

**You will learn how to:**
- Work with the visual programming environment vvvv (gamma)
- Talk to sensors and motors with an Arduino using Firmata
- Send and receive data via OSC 
- Use DMX/ArtNet to control lights
- Use MIDI to talk to musical devices
- Dive into IOT using MQTT

![](InteractionDesign.png) 

## Getting started with Interaction Design
Learn how to track human motion using devices like the Kinect, RealSense or Leap Motion and use the acquired data as input for your interactive installations. Build quick user interfaces to easily tweak parameters and use protocols like OSC, MIDI, DMX to control external devices. All this using the visual programming environment vvvv, which does not require you to write any code. A few mouse clicks are enough to get your interactive prototypes running.

**Who is it for?**
This workshop is for interacton and interactive media designers who need to prototype and develop human machine interactions for your interactive installations.

**You will learn how to:**
- Work with the visual programming environment vvvv (gamma)
- Track hands (Leap Motion) and full bodies (Kinect2, Nuitrack) to create interaction
- Do 2d gesture recognition
- Create simple UserInterfaces

![](DataViz.png) 

## Getting started with Data Visualization
Interested in data visualization but afraid of the coding it usually requires? This workshop is for you! vvvv is a visual programming tool that allows you to do what programmers can do with code. You'll learn how to read data from files or online sources and visualize it with 2d drawing techniques. We'll also show you how to export your creations to vector graphics for further processing them in vector tools like Inkscape or Illustrator.

**Who is it for?**
This workshop is for creative coders, students, data scientists and graphic designers, who want to learn a new way to work with data in their process of making 2d graphics.
