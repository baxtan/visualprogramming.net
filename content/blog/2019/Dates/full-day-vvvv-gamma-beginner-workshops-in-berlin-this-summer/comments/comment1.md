@bo27 prices are per person and corporation is anything bigger than an [SME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises). we believe it is fair play that financially more potent entities pay a higher price, essentially supporting lower prices for individuals. remember we've always had this also for pricing of node-tickets already..
