**Open Call | Wisp Laboratory ‘19**
We are happy to announce the third edition of Wisp Laboratory, which is going to happen at Kontor80 in Leipzig from 23rd to 29th of September.
We welcome artists from across the globe to apply for this unique workshop.
The aim of the Wisp Laboratory is to experiment with future technologies in relation with artistic expression and to increase meeting points and the interaction between artists.
Together we will experiment with a huge variety of digital tools and reconstruct architecturally the audiovisual phenomenon through installations, concerts & performances with collaborative real-time systems.
From 23rd to 27th of September the participants will create concepts and set-up an exhibition/performance/concert space (e.g. 3d audio system, 360° projection, VR, light, sensors) together with the workshop hosts and have time to prepare their shows for the final presentations. In the evenings/nights of the 28th and 29th of September the results will be presented to an audience.

**Workshop Hosts**
The lab will be facilitated by the members of Wisp Collective.

**Location**
The location of the laboratory and performance nights will be in our video and audio labs in Torgauer Straße 80, Leipzig.
