When we started out working on vvvv beta in 2000 at [MESO](https://meso.design), it soon became apparent that it is too useful to keep as an inhouse toolkit only. Therefore we soon decided to offer it for anyone, let's say in the world of *interactive media*, to try and use it. 

Fast forward 19 years and we now have the all-new [vvvv gamma almost ready for prime time](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) and we realise it is too powerful to only constrain its use to cases in *interactive media*. With VL, probably the first .NET language for live programming at its core, vvvv gamma is no longer only an obvious choice for the niche market it grew out of. We have to assume that it can also be successfully used beyond what we've seen so far.

To explore its possibilities, we're exposing vvvv to new audiences, in this case at the [DOTNEXTCONF in Moscow](https://dotnext-moscow.ru/en):

Our talk is [vvvv â€” visual programming for .NET](https://dotnext-moscow.ru/en/2019/msk/talks/3t4hdm2frgmmzu46hmaxbs)

If this is nothing for you personally, then please send your even more nerdy friends!
