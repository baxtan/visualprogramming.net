Once again on short notice:

vvvv heads are meeting for a show and tell with drinks. Everyone is welcome! This time we have presentations by:

* {{< user "everyoneishappy" >}} and {{< user "tonfilm" >}} about progress with Xenko
* {{< user "sebescudie" >}}: an in-house application that allows to visualize, calibrate and perform tracking on one or more LIDARs

*Sebes' LIDAR app*

We'd also love to hear from you: If you have something to show or talk about, please do so! Bring your projects, demos, works-in-progress and show us what you're patching with!
