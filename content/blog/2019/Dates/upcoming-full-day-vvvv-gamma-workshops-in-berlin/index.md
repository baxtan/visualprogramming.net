Helo evvvveryone,

after a successful [first round of vvvvv gamma workshops](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-beginner-workshops-in-berlin-this-summer), we're now filling up the rest of this year with more dates!

As you know, the all-new vvvv gamma is [getting into shape](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) and can already give you an incredible boost in productivity. Therefore in addition to our [free introductory workshops](/blog/2019/upcoming-free-vvvv-gamma-workshops-in-berlin), we're also offering the following series of workshops to get you going proper:

## Getting started with Physical Computing 
Reading data from sensors to control lights and motors connected to a computer via an Arduino, is a breeze if you know how to. The same is true for working with data transfer protocols like OSC, MIDI, MQTT and DMX/ArtNet. Learn all this without the need to write any code, by using the visual programming environment vvvv.

**Who is it for?**
This workshop is for creative coders, students, media artists and makers who want to learn how to communicate between computers and devices.

**You will learn how to:**
- Work with the visual programming environment vvvv (gamma)
- Talk to sensors and motors with an Arduino using Firmata
- Send and receive data via OSC 
- Use DMX/ArtNet to control lights
- Use MIDI to talk to musical devices
- Dive into IOT using MQTT

## Getting started with Computer Vision 
With easy access to the computer vision library (OpenCV) and depth cameras (Kinect, RealSense,...), vvvv is a loyal companion for prototyping your computer vision applications and installations. With its no-code user-interface it allows you to quickly achieve your goals with just a few mouseclicks. Applying video filters, detecting motion and even using latest machine-learning powered techniques like YOLO, to label things in a video stream, becomes accessible to everyone.

**Who is it for?**
This workshop is for creative coders, professionals, students, designers and scientists, who want to learn a new way to analyze and sense realtime video images and get to know computer vision techniques.

**You will learn how to:**
- Work with the visual programming environment vvvv (gamma)
- Use the powerful computervision library [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) in vvvv
- Apply filters to video or still images
- Detect motion in images
- Do background subtraction for tracking
- Detect things in images with [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
- Batch-process still images

![](InteractionDesign2.png) 

## Getting started with Interaction Design
Learn how to track human motion using devices like the Kinect, RealSense or Leap Motion and use the acquired data as input for your interactive installations. Build quick user interfaces to easily tweak parameters and use protocols like OSC, MIDI, DMX to control external devices. All this using the visual programming environment vvvv, which does not require you to write any code. A few mouse clicks are enough to get your interactive prototypes running.

**Who is it for?**
This workshop is for interacton and interactive media designers who need to prototype and develop human machine interactions for your interactive installations.

**You will learn how to:**
- Work with the visual programming environment vvvv (gamma)
- Do 2d gesture recognition
- Track full bodies using Kinect2 to create interaction
- Trigger MIDI notes by hitting virtual boxes in space
- Create simple UserInterfaces

## Getting started with Data Visualization
Interested in data visualization but afraid of the coding it usually requires? This workshop is for you! vvvv is a visual programming tool that allows you to do what programmers can do with code. You'll learn how to read data from files or online sources and visualize it with 2d drawing techniques. We'll also show you how to export your creations to vector graphics for further processing them in vector tools like Inkscape or Illustrator.

**Who is it for?**
This workshop is for creative coders, students, data scientists and graphic designers, who want to learn a new way to work with data in their process of making 2d graphics.

**You will learn how to:**
- Work with the visual programming environment vvvv (gamma)
- Read data from .csv, .xml, and .json files
- Read data from the web
- Create 2d graphics from data
- Export graphics to .svg and .pdf

![](MusicViz.png) 

## Getting started with Music Visualization
Exploring the infinite possibilities of giving shape to sound is a life journey. Thanks to the visual programming language vvvv this exploration can be immediately smooth and playful, allowing you to follow the ephemeral moment of intuition arising from music and taking a creative path through generative real-time graphics.

**Who is it for?**
This workshop is for artists, musicians, creative coders, professionals, students, designers, who want to get into music visualization by generating and interacting with realtime 2d graphics in vvvv.

**You will learn how to:**
- Work with the visual programming environment vvvv (gamma)
- Get Audio signals in vvvv
- Process live audio inputs, extracting meaningful data from it
- Visualize MIDI files and live MIDI events
- Create procedural graphic elements and connect them to the music
- Use the VL.Animation.Particles library to explore visually some aspects of the sound
- Use the Elementa UI library to build a simple user interfaces to manage some aspects of the visuals in a performance enviroment

## Visualprogramming for Coders
Programming is fun, but it sometimes becomes tedious when you have to rebuild your whole application just because you found a careless mistake in your code or want to change some constants. vvvv is a visual live programming environment that allows you to build and change .NET applications in real-time while they are running, thanks to incremental compilation and state hot-reload. Oh, and we are serious about this - everything is statically typed.

**Who is it for?**
You are familiar with words like class, method, interface and generics? You always wanted to change the software you made while it is running? Great, then this workshop is for you!

**You will learn how to:**
* Translate your knowledge about object oriented programming into the visual paradigms of VL.
* Write VL nodes in C#
* Extend your application with third-party libraries from the internet while it is running
* Convert textual code into visual code
* Use generics 

**Requirements**
- Please come with Visual Studio 2019 installed as this takes a while
