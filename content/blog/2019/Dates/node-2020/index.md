#  NODE 2020
##  2 - 8 October 2020 in Frankfurt. 
###  Save that date, prepare your patches and start your travel arrangements.
Dear patchers. 

2019 comes to an end and we are glad to be able to announce the next festival edition for 2020 just before this year ends. It is finally official. NODE Forum for Digital Arts will be happening in October 2020 in Frankfurt. We got the locations and the date. So please save that date and equip yourself with patches, projects, questions, presentations.

See also the [public announcement](https://nodeforum.org/announcements/node-forum-for-digital-arts-2020)

Within the next month, we will be developing the professional program together with you. As usual, we will focus on vvvv, but also invite other communities to plugin to the program to foster exchange and skills and support social and technical integrations from community to community and software to software. As soon as we have some open doors you will be informed..

Lets bring it to life again and create a festival from which we as a community as well as new users and curious minds can expect the finest and most relevant workshops and masterclasses to learn about creative patching techniques from experts and new talents from the international digital art and design scene.

Together with Mousonturm and other international partners, we are also developing the discursive and cultural program for you. We will soon release our next leitmotif that shall be reflected within the community program, exhibition, lectures, talks and labs â€“ so stay tuned for the open call to contribute with your ideas and projects!


A word on whats been[discussed at last link](/blog/link-summercamp-2019-exit). There has been the idea to run a community summit separetly from the node festival. This is indeed something that has been discussed intensly with many people and relevant partners. For now we decided to keep things together and let NODE Forum for Digital Arts be our community gathering as it always was. With all the topics and discussion we need. 


What should I do next?

You may starting to collect topics and workshops here on vvvv.org and contact us for urgent requests. 
You may start making travel arrangements as the date is fixed. It makes sense to think of Thursday 1st or Friday 2nd as the arrival date and to plan your trip back home on October 9th earliest so we can have a final party on the 8th. We will be releasing the tickets soon. 



In the meantime watch that video from the previous edition and get into the mood.
