Here we go,

vvvv berlin meetup #8 is happening at a new location!
Spektrum Berlin [sadly is no more](https://www.gofundme.com/spektrum-exspektrum-rent-recovery). If you ever enjoyed a vvvv meetup or another event there, please consider donating!

Meanwhile the fine people of [Retune Studio](http://retune.de) offered us their space, which we'll gladly occupy next week.

We'll have {{< user "tonfilm" >}} giving us a making-off presentation of [Ocean Of Air](http://oceanofair.com/), the first ever project realized with [vvvv gamma](/blog/2019/vvvv-gamma-2019.1-preview) and the upcoming Xenko 3d engine integration. 

Also we're happy to have {{< user "m9dfukc" >}} talk about "Bodies In Motion" he recently helped realize:
{{< vimeo "329040366" >}}

And as always, feel free to bring your project/notebook/questions or whatever you want to share with the community. We have space and time for spontaneous discussions and presentations!
