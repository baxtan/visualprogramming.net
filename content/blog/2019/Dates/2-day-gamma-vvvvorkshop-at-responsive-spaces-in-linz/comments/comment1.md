@schlonzo: we'll be going through a bunch of examples making sure everyone gets the most fundamental principles that are: loops and datatypes. also i'll talk about document/patch organization, referencing other documents and .NET nugets. if you're comfortable with vvvv beta, this workshop aims at making your comfortable with vvvv gamma.
