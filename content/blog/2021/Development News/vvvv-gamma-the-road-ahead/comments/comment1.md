the first reason is just pragmatic, .NET5 is the progression of the technology we're using. but there are several advantages that come with it:
* many performance improvements of the runtime -> faster patches
* the .NET5 runtime is cross-platform -> potentially export for macOS/linux
* preparation for .NET6 which will finally have a [cross-platform UI framework](https://github.com/dotnet/maui) -> potentially patching on macOS
* we can use cutting edge libraries that don't bother about NET Framework anymore -> more machine learning

and Stride will also move to .NET5 with the next version, so if we want to stay up to date with their developments, we also have to be on .NET5 soon.
