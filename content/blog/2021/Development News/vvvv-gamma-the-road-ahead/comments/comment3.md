i'd say it is less important to patch on macOS but release stuff for macOS or even more important for iOS. The multiplattform release feature made me use Unity in the first place. You won't be more productive by using vvvv on OSX, its the same thing in the end. Of course it might attract more people to vvvv. But that's a bet and not certain it makes a big impact.

Anyway, exciting news, thanks for the post.
