You won't be more productive by using vvvv on OSX, its the same thing in the end. Of course it might attract more people to vvvv. But that's a bet and not certain it makes a big impact.{{< /box >}}

You are certainly right that's the same thing in the end ... but also it depends on the perspective of the user. Me being a MacOs user and having my complete workflow centered around that platform, it is just a pain in the a** to solely start Windows for vvvv. Unfortunately I think this rings true for many Designers which are in a similar situation than me. When I was teaching vvvv at the UDK several years back I had a hard time finding students because most of them where on a Mac and not willing to install Windows :/ Looking around I guess this still hasn't changed that much.

But I absolutely get that (as small as the vvvv group is) it might be more important to focus on the general experience than getting tangled up in supporting patching on the Mac or other niche platforms (Linux looking at you :) But I have to second u7angel that exporting to iOs and Android should be high on this list as we get more and more (capable) mobile devices saturating the market.

Really looking forward what lies ahead!
