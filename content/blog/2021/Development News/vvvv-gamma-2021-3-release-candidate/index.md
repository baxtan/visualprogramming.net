**[vvvv gamma 2021.3.0 RC2](https://teamcity.vvvv.org/guestAuth/app/rest/builds/id:33615/artifacts/content/vvvv_gamma_2021.3.0-0051-gbe6e8e0fb2_setup.exe)**{{< /box >}}

This is going to be the first stable release including the huge shiny new 3d rendering library we created based on the [Stride Engine](http://stride3d.net)!

For more details of what's new, please consult the [Change Log](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2021.3.html).

So please test and report your findings. If we don't find any complete show-stoppers within the next days, this is going to be it!
