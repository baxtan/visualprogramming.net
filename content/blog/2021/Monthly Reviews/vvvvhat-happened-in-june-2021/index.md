Helo from the devvvvlabs!

If you look at [our roadmap](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/roadmap/planned.html), you can see that we had 2021.4 planned for release in June. Now that didn't happen. Here is what happened instead: Guess what, some things took longer than anticipated. So let's recap the state of currently available 2021.4 previews. Besides numerous bug fixes, here is what you already get:
* Speed improvements for working on larger projects are there, but still with some buggers 
* TextureFX are there but will see one more round of polishing
* Spout nodes recently got a final polish 
* Some little goodies: Renderer ViewPorts, MeshSplit (Experimental), Pipet (Experimental), a non blocking BufferReadback, Custom material overrides, ShaderFX node factory, automatic ShaderFX input pins for all shader types
* Reworked, convenient Buffer and Texture creation nodes have recently been added
* Explicit Type Parameters have recently been added, [see discussion](https://github.com/vvvv/VL-Language/issues/39)
* The This node can be used inside of Create, [see discussion](https://github.com/vvvv/VL-Language/issues/21)

Still in the works for the release: a UI for Settings, simple shader creation, Entity picking, a TexturePlayer. Other things like the planned NuGet update are currently on hold and may have to be moved to the next release.

As many of you do, you can always help by testing the [latest previews](visualprogramming.net/#Download) and [reporting issues in the forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/vvvv-gamma/bug/31)!
