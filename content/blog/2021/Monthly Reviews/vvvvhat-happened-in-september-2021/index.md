Aaaahoi!

The single biggest news this month: The FUSE team had their [preview release party](https://youtu.be/4xDShgbKTsQ) and people are since fusing aways like there's no tomorrow. Check it out, you don't want to be the last one who joins the hype! Any questions? Get them answered in the shiny new [dedicated FUSE section](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/fuse/37) of the forum.

In addition, we had two regular vvvv meetups which you should watch if you don't want to miss out on the latest shenanigans: [meetup 13](https://youtu.be/2gGPh84y-mU) and [meetup 14](https://youtu.be/L9zy-dJw-HQ).

And a secret tip: {{< user "dottore" >}} giving an [update on the status of the VL.Kairos project](https://youtu.be/7ShAW9oL6kA).

How are things regarding the upcoming 2021.4 release? Good, glad you ask! We've just recently merged the promised Settings UI, which is actually bigger news than what meets the eye. We'll have to talk about this separately... TextureFX have recently left the experimental stage and so have the Video- and TexturePlayers that still have an announcement pending. But really, [latest 2021.4 previews](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download) already have all of this in for you to test. And still a few more things to come...
