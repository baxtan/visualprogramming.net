What's on and going?
I can tell you that:

We've just released a [2021.3.3](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2021.3.html) bugfix release including a killer feature: console export. think about it...

Then if you're brave enough to test drive the 2021.4 previews you'll now see the promised speed improvements while patching when working on larger projects. We're still aware of some hoops there, so please be gentle and report all your findings with this.

Coming up next: We're still working on smoothing out issues with TextureFX, building a UI for the settings and improving the NuGet integration for the [coming release](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/roadmap/planned.html). Plus, if we're lucky there'll be some surprise goodies ready in time...
