So where are we?

We have a new release: Update your vvvv beta projects and [licenses](https://store.vvvv.org), [vvvv beta 42](/blog/2021/vvvv50beta42) is here, including VL 2021.3.3. This means a lot of [fixes and improvements](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/changelog/2021.3.html)!

And then we're still sorting things for the upcoming vvvv gamma 2021.4 release. Besides massive work on new features for VL.Stride as [mentioned previously](/blog/2021/vvvvhat-happened-in-june-2021), recently VL.Skia 2d rendering got its GPU backend fixed. This improved its rendering performance and also made the VL.Stride [SkiaRenderer node work for AMD cards](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/skiarenderer-not-working-since-3-0/18810/33).

Nothing much else to report at this point other than that while we're quite delayed on our [roadmap](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/roadmap/planned.html), things are looking good code-wise. Remeber that you can always follow our daily progress by testing the [latest previews](visualprogramming.net/#Download). And please don't forget to [report issues you find in the forum](https://discourse.vvvv.org/c/vvvv-gamma/bug/31)!
