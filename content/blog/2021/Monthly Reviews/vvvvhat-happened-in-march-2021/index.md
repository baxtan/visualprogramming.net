On the road again!

This time [towards vvvv gamma 2021.4](/blog/2021/vvvv-gamma-the-road-ahead). Nothing much in the public previews yet, but a few things probably dropping there in the next few weeks. In particular, we've been working on the patching performance issue, TextureFX, the Buffer nodes and the Settings UI. So expect these things to show up in previews first. And if you haven't yet, please review [what happened recently in VL.Stride land](/blog/2021/vl-stride-3d-engine-update-4).
