So,

December happened and what not happened is the planned release of 2020.3, the first stable one including the shiny new 3d engine VL.Stride, as planned. We're in the final commits for it, so please bear with us and just [get a preview](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download) if you can't wait.

Meanwhile, the promised [rework of the OSC and TUIO nodes](/blog/2020/vl-new-osc-and-tuio-nodes) has landed in previews, which should make it the easiest ever to work with those two ubiquitous protocols.

## Working Groups

I think it makes sense to start giving you an overview of a few bigger community efforts that have recently started. Please add your expertise where you see fit! Hoping we can gather some regular updates from them in the coming months:

* The [FUSE project](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/fuse-project/19000) is building GPU tools and libraries to use with VL.Stride. You can [support them here](https://store.vvvv.org/products/fuse)
* The [Universal Skeleton Bible](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/universal-skeleton-bible/19059) is meeting for the first time next week
* A new [VL.ML chat room](https://app.element.io/#/room/#vl.ml:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) just opened to discuss all things vvvv and machine learning
