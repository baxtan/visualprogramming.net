We're meeting up on **June 22nd, 8pm CET** to catch up and get insights into what everyone is patching on. How will this work? Something like [the last time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuDZGIvxR9U). So please fill up your bucket of popcorn and invite all your vvvvriends and vvvvamily to join us!

##  Want to share your work?
Please do! Anything more or less related to vvvv, yourself and your projects. Share some thoughts, share your funny fails. Or just ask some questions...

No sign-up, no line-up! We'll just have this an open call that anyone can join. Surprise!
