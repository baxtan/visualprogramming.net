Hello vvvvolks,

It’s happening!  After many moons of deep contemplation and hard work we are thrilled to announce the first public preview release of Fuse on 14/09/21.  We will also be making an online presentation party to accompany the release, kindly hosted by the Node Institute. That's this coming Tuesday at 21:00 Berlin Time…

We will take an introductory tour of what has been produced and discuss future directions for The FUSE Lab.

Hope to see you there,

The Fuse Lab team
