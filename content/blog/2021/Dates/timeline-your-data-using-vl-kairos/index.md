When it comes to timelines and tools to create data narratives vvvv never offered many options. Kairos is not only a tool to finally address this need. It also introduces a vast range of possibilities for managing live data and controlling your applications.
Starting from the comprehension of the very essence of kairos principles, weâ€™ll then familiarize with the library node set and patch together some use case scenarios.


Soon it will be obvious that Kairos is not only a solution for common known problems, but truly a new land to be explored, where to shape new methodologies and creative paths.

You are learning directly from Instructor Natan Sinigaglia (aka dottore), who is the developer behind VL.Kairos and other vvvv libraries such as the UI library VL.Elementa . 

##  **New date!!**
**Unfortunately we have to postpone the workshop due to important improvements in the Kairos development and also private scheduling difficulties. The new date is March 30, 2020 from 13:30 - 18:00**
