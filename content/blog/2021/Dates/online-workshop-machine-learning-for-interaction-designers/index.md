Hurray. Another one:

**This workshop is for interaction designers who work with vvvv. The online workshop by vvvvamous {{< user "sebescudie" >}} will introduce you to tools enabling you to leverage machine learning capabilities in your own vvvv patches.**

As the name of the webinar suggests, we’ll talk about machine learning through the prism of interactive installations. We won’t go into much details inside the math behind it. This is actually the whole point of this webinar: there are some tools out there that can help us leverage the capabilities of machine learning without having to know too much about what’s under the hood.

Through a series of practical examples (and a tiny bit of theory!), we’ll try to understand what machine learning is, and how using it can help us in our everyday patching life, and allow us to do things that would be very tedious to do without it.


You will learn how to:

* What are machine learning and deep learning
* Use RunwayML trained model in your vvvv patches
* Talk to the Wekinator
* Train your own models with Microsoft Lobe
