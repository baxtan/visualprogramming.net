Dear educators!

With the all-new [vvvv gamma](http://visualprogramming.net/) finally having all the necessary bits together for being a serious creative coding environment, we believe it is also a premium tool for education. In case you need to argue:

## Reasons to use vvvv in education
* It is free for educational use without any restrictions
* It is quick and easy to install, with no copy protection or need for registration
* It comes with extensive documentation, accessible right from an integrated Help Browser
* It connects to most popular protocols and devices
* It allows to teach programming concepts like object oriented programming and dataflow in a visual way
* While being a visual language, it can easily be extended via C# and the use of .NET Nugets
* Its libraries are open-source, thus can be inspected and learned from

## Becoming a vvvv teacher
If you want to help us spread vvvv by teaching (with) it, we want to make sure you don't feel lost in its universe. "Mastering vvvv for teaching" is an intensive 8 week (16 sessions) live online course with the goal of making you a confident vvvv teacher.
