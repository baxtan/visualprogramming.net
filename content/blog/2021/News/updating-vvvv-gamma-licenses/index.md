If you're the happy owner of one or even more vvvv gamma licenses, please read on.
(Otherwise, please [join the club](https://store.vvvv.org/) first)

Remember: If you update your vvvv gamma license before it runs out, we thank you for your loyalty with a **20% discount**. Updating a license means keeping it active and allowing you to use all the latest releases for your commercial projects. 

## Just a few clicks
When logged into [the vvvv store](https://store.vvvv.org) you can get an overview of all your vvvv gamma licenses by choosing the "Licenses" section. It could look something like this:

Grayed-out licenses are inactive and can no longer be updated. Active licenses can be updated anytime which will always add one year to their current end-date. You can also update multiple licenses at once to have them all on one invoice. Convenient.

Note that you can change who's paying for the license: This will mostly make sense for people who started out with an "Individual" license but start feeling more pro and now want to pay as a "Freelancer, SME,...". But there are also reports of pro's feeling lucky and turning into a big fish. You will not be judged!

## Email notification
You're all busy people, so in order to help you find a good moment to update you'll receive 3 email notifications:
- 4 weeks 
- 2 weeks
- 1 day
before a license end-date to remind you of the possibility to update earning the discount.

Note:
If you're not receiving those emails, you may have changed your email since you signed up for your vvvv.org account. This happened a couple of times already, so please get in touch if you need your email address changed!

That's already it. Shouldn't take you more than two minutes to update your licenses once a year. For the benefit of not having to worry about which version you're eligible to use and the peace of mind of properly feeding your workhorse...
