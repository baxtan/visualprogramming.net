**Curious to see how vvvv can help you get things done?**
**We'd like to give you a tour!**{{< /box >}}

Depending on who you are, vvvv can be your:
* Creative coding toolkit
* .NET live-programming environment
* Show control station
* Rapid prototyping toolbox
* Physical computing hub

vvvv is equally well suited for **realizing projects** and using it in **research** and **education**, especially in the following fields:
* Generative Design
* Interaction Design
* Data Visualization
* Computer Vision
* Virtual- and Augmented Reality
* Machine Learning

You can start your own research about vvvv in [The Gray Book](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/) or request a demo, where we jump on a screen-share call with you and answer all your questions. This should be the quickest way to figure out if vvvv could be a good fit for you and your team.
