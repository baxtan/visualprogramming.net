Dear Devvvvelopers,

As you're well aware, vvvv gamma has been on an earlybird discount for nearly a year now. We bow to the early adopters and supporters who've bought their licenses already. ThankyouSOverymuch!

This is the final call for everyone who still hasn't taken the bait:

**Get your developer licenses until April 1st, 2021 to save 20%**

## Still need convincing?
vvvv has the self-proclaimed "most fair commercial licensing model" in the world. Let's have a look:

- No copy-protection
- No mandatory registration
- No feature limitations
- Pay per size of your business (Individual, Freelancer or SME, Big Fish)
- You own the last version you paid for
- Monthly payment options

## What this means for your business
* No hassle with dongles or other kinds of DRM:
 ** Production: download -> install -> run vvvv wherever you need it
 ** Deployment: export as executable and distribute
* Everyone always gets the full functionality, no artificial limitations
* By paying less as a smaller business, it is easier for you to get started. By paying more as a bigger business, you're investing in a healthy and diverse user base and allow us to keep vvvv free for educational use
* As opposed to current trends in software licensing where you can no longer use a software when you stop paying for its subscription, with a yearly vvvv developer license you own the last version you paid for, forever. 
* You can easily add developers to your team temporarily by paying for their seats monthly

As you can see, we don't need no [#NFT](https://everestpipkin.medium.com/but-the-environmental-issues-with-cryptoart-1128ef72e6a3) to trust you to correctly declare your commercial use of vvvv.

Happy patching evvvveryone!
