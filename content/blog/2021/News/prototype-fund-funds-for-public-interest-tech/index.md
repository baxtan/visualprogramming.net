If you haven't heard of vvvv yet: It is a visual live-programming environment that accompanies you from prototyping to final production. Here is [what vvvv can do for you](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/). 

If you haven't heard of the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/en/) yet:

{{< box >}}
*The Prototype Fund supports ideas in civic tech, data literacy, data security and software infrastructure. We want to provide software developers, hackers, and creatives with the opportunity to code and develop innovative public interest technologies.*

*\*\*You can apply for our current application round until March 31, 2021 (11:59 p.m.).\*\**

*As individual developers or small interdisciplinary project teams, you will receive up to â‚¬47,500 over six months from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. With this funding, you can write code and develop a first prototype of your software. In addition, we will connect you with tech and other relevant communities, support you with coaching, and advise you on project implementation and communication.*

*\*\*Who can apply?\*\**
*Self-employed developers and small teams who live in Germany can apply for funding.*

*\*\*Open Source\*\**
*Your results must be made publicly available under an open source license.*{{< /box >}}

For inspiration, here is a [listing of previously funded projects](https://prototypefund.de/en/projects/).

And here are some reasons to use vvvv for your Prototype Fund project:
* The visual live-programming nature of vvvv means that it is especially good for quickly iterating on prototypes
* You can now [create standalone applications](https://youtu.be/Pj1QVqM0QJA) to distribute results as Windows apps
* FOSS development with vvvv does not require a commercial license and thus is entirely free without any limitations
* The friendly community will most likely be able to [help you out in case you get stuck](https://discourse.vvvv.org/)

Let us know what you're working on. We'd love to hear from your projects!
