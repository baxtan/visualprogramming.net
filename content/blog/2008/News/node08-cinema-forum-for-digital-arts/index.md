**Dear friends and vvvv users.**

For a few years now, the nice community of our multipurpose toolkit has been growing and growing. Many of you have been in contact virtually, but never really met. This needs to change.

April 5 - 12, 2008: [NODE08](http://node08.vvvv.org/) – Forum For Digital Arts

[WORKSHOPS](http://node08.vvvv.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/node08-timetable-feb-25.pdf)
[LECTURES](http://node08.vvvv.org/?page_id=81)
[EXHIBITION](http://node08.vvvv.org/?cat=1)
[VVVVINISAGE](http://node08.vvvv.org/?page_id=81)

NODE08 is not profit-oriented. However, participation in the workshops and lectures requires a ticket: this helps to pay for costs and expenses of the lecturers, artists, rentals, gear, etc. Relating to the licensing scheme of vvvv, we trust our guests to choose the right ticket scheme.
Besides the Fan-Pass for non-commercial users, we'd especially like to advertise the Pro-Pass at EUR 444,— granting free access to all workshops, lectures and the grande finissage.

The Pro-Pass is meant to be the right ticket for those who think the NODE08 Visit is more commercial than personal. By buying the Pro-Pass you become an official Sponsor of NODE08. It also guarantees peace of mind in case the knowledge gained in attending the workshops, which are held by honorary workshop facilitators, is going to be applied incommercial projects.

We would like to thank you in advance for supporting NODE08 by buying the Pro-Pass. To be recognisable as a sponsor, the Pro-Pass badge will be colour-coded.

The available tickets are …
Full week Pro-Pass (all included) EUR 444
Full week Fan-Pass (all included) sold out
3Day-Pass (April 5 - 7) EUR 55
2Day-Pass (April 9 - 10) EUR 55
2Day-Pass (April 11 - 12) EUR 55
Lecture-Pass (April 8) EUR 33
