CUDA.NET is an effort by GASS to provide access to CUDA functionality through .NET applications.
The library currently provides .NET bindings for CUDA functions, allowing programmers to use existing .NET applications as hosts for CUDA enabled devices, this way exposing a strong co-processor that can be used with .NET.

The provided file contains a .NET library that can be used from any .NET application and language, along with examples in C# and Python showing how to use the library. The API is very straight forward and compatible with CUDA API available for C applications with few modifications to ease development and align with .NET standards.
