hello vvvvisualizers,

do any of you work on datasets? here is a call for videos that just reached me:

[vizNET 2008](http://www.viznet.ac.uk/home) encourages attendees to submit a short video clip for inclusion in one of the early presentation sessions. We are very keen for attendees to have the opportunity to fully participate during the event. Whilst some people may prefer to show off some of their work we also recognise that some attendees may be more interested in highlighting a problem they are trying to solve and which they would like to share with others. For instance you may have a particularly challenging data set with no immediately obvious means of teasing out important features of the underlying data set properties. By bringing examples of such challenges to vizNET 2008 it is highly likely that other people attending the vizNET event will be able to suggest possible ways of solving the problems.
