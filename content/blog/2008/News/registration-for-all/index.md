helohelo,

as it came to our attention registration on our tikiwiki obviously didn't send registration mails to some users. we did some debugging and fixing on this and suggest that users who had this problem now try again. 

if you still have problems please don't hesitate to use our guest/guest login and report your findings in our [tiki forum](http://legacy.vvvv.org/tiki-view_forum.php?forumId=2)

yours,
vvvvadmin
