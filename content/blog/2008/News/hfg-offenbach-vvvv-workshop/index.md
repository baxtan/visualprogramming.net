Jannis Kreft is giving a vvvv workshop at the HfG Offenbach in the class E-Bild every second thursday of the semester & additional lectures on the weekends. The workshop starts with the basics of vvvv programming and later on has a focus on tracking techniques and the visualisation of music. 

The patches of this workshop will be available for download later on.
