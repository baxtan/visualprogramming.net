Ionian University) co organize an intense five day and night program listing international shows and productions, for innovative media art, electronic music and cross-over art with artists such as musicians, video artists, performers, sonic artists, involving different arts and lifestyles.

ElectroMediaWorks ’08 is hosted at a 1800-square meter industrial space down town Athens. A complete 16-channel diffusion system will be in place for the electroacoustic works and the live electronics and a 5.1 surround system for the video art installations.
