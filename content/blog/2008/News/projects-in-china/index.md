Hi, we are the Chinese branch of SYMA (www.syma.com.cn), a global service provider in exhibitions and events. We are looking for partners/vendors/suppliers to work with us on a regular basis in multiple projects involving advanced interactive installations in China. This could be part-time work by freelancers, or formal contracts with suppliers involving remote development and setup on location in China.

We are also looking for full-time staff to be based in Shanghai (project management).

If you're interested or know someone who can provide this kind of service, please contact me at ricardo.andrade@syma.com.cn.

Not sure if this is the right place for a post like this - apologize if it's not.

Thanks
Ricardo Andrade
