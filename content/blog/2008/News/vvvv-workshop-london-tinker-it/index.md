helo london people,

any of you not confident with vvvv yet? there is an opportunity to change that. i've been invited by [tinker.it](http://tinker.it) to host a [vvvv-workshop](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/learning/courses/workshops.html) as part of their [ongoing series of workshops](http://tinker.it/now/workshops/). and even if you are confident already come and bring your questions and ideas. we'll surely find some things to tinker about. looking forward to see you there.

for more details and registration go to the [vvvv-workshop site on tinker.it](http://tinkerit.eventwax.com/vvvv-workshop)
