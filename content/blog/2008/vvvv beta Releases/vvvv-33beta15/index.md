horray. just right in time for [node08](http://node08.vvvv.org/) a new release: 33beta15. 
lots of stuff this time:
* WavePlayer fixed+enhanced
* {{< user "kalle" >}} gets his node IDs
* {{< user "eno" >}} gets his SourceBuffer
* 2008 style copypaste features for everyone
* greatly improved [glossary](glossary) (debug your clients!)
ja, and a fix here and a new bug there, of course.

[Read the log for changes](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/core/change-log-vvvv33beta15.html)

have we mentioned beta14.9? actually if all goes well with beta15 it shouldn't be of any interest. really only if beta15 feels strange in a way you may want to check against beta14.9 and report if you find any obvious differences that may help us debugging. 

for now have a nice patch,
see you at node08,
your vvvv group.
