holahola,

so what do we have this time...see for yourself: [Change Log](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/core/change-log-vvvv40beta18.html)
nothing big, but thanks to our intern elias a lot of fixed bits and some new funky set-theory nodes. also check the enhanced {{< node "Expr (Value) " >}} node which can now deal with arbitrary variable inputs.

now have a good patch.

yours.
devvvvs.
