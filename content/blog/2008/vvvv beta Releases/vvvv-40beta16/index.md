helo nodes,

surely a small step for mankind but still worth noting is vvvvs newly built in open plugininterface that allows anyone to write their own plugin-nodes. horray. still without documentation at this moment, which shall be changed shortly after Node08 has finished. bare with us..

a real revolution in interface design though is offered by the patentpending Kalle (VVVV) node. handle with care.

all the best,
yours vvvvgroup.
