привет!
finally.

yes we can. see: [Log of Change](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/changelog/core/change-log-vvvv40beta19.html)!
a little bit here, a little bit there.

been also working hard to get the plugins integrated in the release cycle and indeed in a view days you should be able to download the first addonpack. plugin developers please read [AddOns-Packaging](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/devvvveloping/addons/howto-release-a-pack.html), prepare their code accordingly and test it against this release. if all goes well we should be able to release the pack early next week.
