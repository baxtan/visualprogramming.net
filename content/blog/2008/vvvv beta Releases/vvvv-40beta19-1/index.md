All modules have been reviewed and come with BRAND NEW help patches. 
Really.

and: Addon package opens its module doors.

that is: If you want to see your modules permanently in the addon package you can contribute; also means, that all must have modules will be accessible very easily via one download (the addon package). When everything goes well we'll come to a stage where no more searching through hundreds of zips is necessary. 

and off course bug fixes...
