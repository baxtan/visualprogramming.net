dear audiophiles and ordinary maintainace release lovers,

you might want to check that out:
* audio ON: now you can plug your favorite [VST](http://www.legacy.vvvv.org/tiki-index.php?page=VST) instrument / effect into vvvv. also have a look on the waveplayer patches in \girlpower\+Sound.
* patch OFF: there's a new commandline option "/shutup" to finish your project in a clean way. only renderers are displayed. only the ALT-F4 shortcut works.

also:
* FUZZY stuff: Ctrl+F1: ##vvvv on irc.freenode.net now should work always and from everywhere 
* SUPERTRUE: browse the nodelist.xml to get all the facts about your beloved nodes

all the best!
all the devvvs, 
all the group
