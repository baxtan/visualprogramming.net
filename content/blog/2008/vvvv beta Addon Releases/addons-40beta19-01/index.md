good days,

as promised, early this week here you are. this is the first addonpack. for now containing only plugins, modules will follow shortly... 

credits go to all who contributed. it is a massive first pack: 65 individual plugin-nodes! among them such jeweles as:
* an implementation of the [Bass Audio Library](http://www.un4seen.com/) including support for ASIO devices
* Tablet (Devices WinTab)
* WiiMote (Devices)
to name just a few of my personal favorites. a complete list of included files is in the download \bin\addonlist.xml

note that the plugins are not yet integrated in the wiki-ReferencePages, but will be soon!

now it is your turn to test and report problems. all further infos concerning addons should from now on be found on the dedicated [AddOns](https://betadocs.vvvv.org/devvvveloping/addons/) page.
