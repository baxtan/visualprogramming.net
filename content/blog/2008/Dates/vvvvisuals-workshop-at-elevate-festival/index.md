Description:
A beginner´s workshop for the multipurpose toolkit VVVV. The workshop runs for two days and requires no previous knowledge. After introducing the user interface of vvvv and its paradigms of a visual, node based programming language, you’ll learn to create various essential patches from scratch. 

The focus of this workshop is creating real time live visuals with VVVV. Your hosts will be [Katharina Mayrhofer](http://strichpunkt.in) and [Philipp Steinweber](http://phl.kontxt.net), both working for [MESO Digital Interiors](http://meso.net) in Frankfurt. 

Windows laptop computer required, installation of latest vvvv appreciated. Windows via Apple boot camp is ok, but you won't have much fun with Parallels.
